We had our first meetup in London last Tuesday at the beautiful Microsoft Reactor located in the centre of the city! Members of the TerminusDB team from Dublin and Berlin came to visit the community. Of course, there were pizzas and lots of beers!

We got so much love for our swags! London Terminators participated and won our e-coffee mugs that made out of bamboo. I hope they will bring them in when buying their morning dose of coffee in their favourite coffee shops. Also, we gave out lots of our Cowduck stickers and T-shirts. Cowduck is winning the heart of Terminators!

Luke, our Commercial Lead, gave a warm welcome to all the Terminators. He told a story about the origin of Cowduck and announced a competition that you don‚Äôt wanna miss (¬£100 Amazon gift coupon, swags and speaking opportunities!) Make sure you enter before 17th March 2020 (St. Patrick‚Äôs Day!).

Our BDFL (benevolent dictator for life) Gavin Mendel-Gleason gave a talk about the internals of TerminusDB. It covers a lot of the design that explains why TerminusDB can store data like git and do it in an efficient way. Our Terminators are very interested and asked a lot of questions. Slides can be found here.

After a short break, we continued with a short workshop in creating a knowledge graph with bike hire data. It was a great success as most of our Terminators has created a graph with no problems! Terminators are smart! In case you missed it or if you want to revisit the tutorial, we have a step by step guide here in [this blog](https://medium.com/terminusdb/my-first-terminusdb-graph-visualisation-bike-share-data-39c59a1ab86a?source=friends_link&sk=2f877df5dcb2f00b9e4e85d5088f015e).
