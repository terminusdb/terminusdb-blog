**TerminusDB is a Founding Member of the AI Infrastructure Alliance**

TerminusDB, along with 25+ fellow pioneers in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) infrastructure, is pleased to announce the creation of the [AI Infrastructure Alliance](https://ai-infrastructure.org/) (AIIA), a non-profit organization with the goal of building a comprehensive collaborative ecosystem for businesses and communities in the AI and ML space. We are proud to be the only Irish company bringing Ireland to the forefront of AI & ML.

Alliance collaborations can help develop a Canonical Stack for AI by driving strong engineering standards and creating seamless points of convergence between different layers of the ecosystem of the AI infrastructure. Canonical means "a set of rules, criteria, and values by which everything is measured," and a Canonical Stack (CS) for AI will set the standard for how businesses design and develop scale models of machine learning. Instead of reinventing the wheel on every data science project, it will let data scientists and data engineers step up the stack to solve more challenging, higher-order issues.

A common selection of tools and solutions are currently missing in the AI and ML space, blocking data science teams from sharing their work and collaborating around the globe. Rather, there is a crazy abundance of proprietary, cloud lock-in solutions for individual enterprises, but not for data scientists and engineers developing today and tomorrow's AI applications. To help those data science teams break out of lock-in, the Alliance came together so that they can build on a standardized, open framework that works across all their environments.

TerminusDB helps you to manage all development stages of the ML lifecycle within existing operating processes, allowing companies to easily, efficiently, and cost-effectively manage data and bring models into production. TerminusDB optimizes collaboration, provides the full suite of revision control features and ensures advanced security and governance. TerminusDB simply integrates with other best-in-class resources during the ML lifecycle. That is why we are so proud to be an AIIA founding member.

The Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Alliance is a consortium of leading start-ups in artificial intelligence with the goal of helping every business realize AI's endless potential. The Alliance, established in February 2021, focuses on linking the complex network of existing AI technologies into a single Canonical Stack, providing the framework on which impactful AI projects can be run by any organization, from small start-ups to global companies. To learn more about the AIIA visit <https://ai-infrastructure.org/>.

The core founding members include Pachyderm, Seldon, Determined AI, Algorithmia, Tecton, ClearML by Allegro AI, Neu.ro, ZenML by Maiot, DAGsHub, TerminusDB, WhyLabs, YData, Superb AI, Valohai, Superwise.ai, cnvrg.io, Arize AI, CometML, Iguazio, UbiOps, and Fiddler. These companies have raised over $200M in collective venture capital funding from top firms including Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, GV, Benchmark, NorWest Venture Partners, Madrona Venture Group and Gradient Ventures.
