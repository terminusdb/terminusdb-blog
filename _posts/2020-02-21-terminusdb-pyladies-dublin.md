Hello Terminators!

A first — for me at least — attending PyLadies, Dublin!

PyLadies helps more women become active participants and leaders in the Python open-source community. PyLadies Dublin also provides a friendly support network for women and a bridge to the larger Python world. Anyone with an interest in Python is encouraged to participate. You can see more [here](https://www.meetup.com/PyLadiesDublin/) — we really enjoyed, so I’d encourage people to attend.

TerminusDB Developer Advocate Extraordinaire, Cheuk, spoke at the PyLadies event earlier this week. There were about 40 PyLadies in the audience and a sprinkling of interloping PyMen.

The event took place in the Dublin office of Qualtrics, which has a full replica of an Irish pub. Another good reason to attend!

Cheuk used TerminusDB to ask if we are supporting the correct politician. She used data from the Dublin City Council. It is a fascinating use case, and relevant in Ireland as we have just had an inconclusive election (and might have another in the not too distant future). There is a run through of the demo [over here](/2020/01/15/are-you-supporting-the-right-politician/) — give it a try.

The full video of the excellent presentation is here:

TerminusDB is open source now and forever so it is perfect for the Python community. We are rolling out ever more features for Pythonistas — check out our [python query client](/2020/01/20/design-a-query-language-client-for-pythonistas-and-data-scientists/)! And watch this space for exciting news.

We’ll keep you up to date with reports from TerminusDB talks and events. A veritable Terminator news service.
