        <title>Write up of our Webinar - TerminusDB Internals</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As enthusiastic Terminators, we all want to know how TerminusDB works. We want to know how with Prolog and Rust it works like magic: provide functions like git, allows rollback, branch and merge. Last week I asked our BDFL Gavin Mendel-Gleason – creator of TerminusDB, technical and no so technical questions about TemrinusDB internals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can access to all our webinars as podcasts here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcast.terminusdb.com/&quot;&gt;https://podcast.terminusdb.com/&lt;/a&gt; including last week’s interview with Gavin, newest and previous episodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I highlighted some of the questions and answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-did-you-decide-to-build-terminusdb-building-a-fully-featured-db-is-hard-and-takes-ages&quot;&gt;Why did you decide to build TerminusDB? Building a fully featured DB is hard and takes ages?!?!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good question, and sometimes ask myself if it made sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were working on Seshat Global History Databank, it was an ambitious project cause it consists of information about all historical societies, including a huge range of different factors about the polities that needed to be stored. My co-founder Kevin Feeney and I were trying to find the information architecture that would allow us to retain this very large amount and very diverse data and allow it to be changed over time. It’s a very multi-disciplinary project, lots of different people, from archaeologist to mathematical modellers, would be involved. The data structure may need to be changed and we need to store rich data and have quality control, curate data and that it would allow all kinds of complexity. Including information disagreements, confidence in the data, whether it was derived or from direct observation. We tested a bunch of different databases to see if it would fit, but eventually started from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-prolog-prolog-is-not-very-popular-choice-in-developing-software&quot;&gt;Why Prolog? Prolog is not very popular choice in developing software.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a strange choice. Initially, we started in Java with Linked Data libraries. As the development goes, I keep feeling that I was implementing a Prolog interpreter to check data, so why not just use a Prolog. Inference checking is core to Prolog and even the slower implementation in Prolog turns out to be very fast in this case and it is well-designed to handle this job. If you are doing first-order logic, datalog type queries, the best way is to leverage Prolog. Prolog can do all the things that SQL can do and can add some complexity and perform recursive queries as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-the-biggest-advantage-of-terminusdb-what-makes-it-stands-out&quot;&gt;What’s the biggest advantage of TerminusDB? What makes it stands out?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it is quite different from other databases. I would say it the holistic approach to data management. Because we have used a graph to represent things that allow for flexibility and you can use a large range of models. It uses a subset of OWL which provides a very rich modelling language - It allows you to model with inheritance. It’s something that relational databases and management systems are lacking. It becomes problematic because they cannot derive a property form relational tables. Because we have a strong and flexible schema we can use our graph database as a document store - each document is described by the schema, so you can pull out from and update a JSON document in the database. In fact, it is all stored as a graph internally so it could be searched as a graph and give us the flexibility that is not commonly found in other databases. And because of the immutable storage system we also have the capacity to go back in time, query on former databases - you can time travel. That is another big advantage of immutable storage approach.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Write up of our Webinar - DataOps 101</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week we had out Webinar about DataOps. I ask my colleague - Dmytri Kleiner, Director Of Services at TerminusDB some questions about DataOps (mostly questions that myself and many of you have in mind).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can access to all our webinars as podcasts here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcast.terminusdb.com/&quot;&gt;https://podcast.terminusdb.com/&lt;/a&gt; including this interview with Dmytri and a previous one with the founders of TerminusDB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-dataops-whats-the-difference-between-devops-and-dataops&quot;&gt;What is Dataops? What’s the difference between Devops and Dataops?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we have to know what is Devops. Developers and operations were once totally separate - there was a wall between and this caused difficulties as they couldn’t understand what was there and what the implications. It took too long and too difficult to get into production. Integration and delivery were painful things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there come new inventions, in the developer community Git and GitHub became popular. While in the ops world, cloud computing became prominent. And there is infrastructure as code, so the two becomes closer and closer together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Devops is a change of the philosophy - Rather than having a developer and operations silo - you have within teams ability to combine the two silos. CI/CD is allowed with this pipeline approach. Development to testing to production is enabled and a pipeline is developed that involved various stages and the infrastructure can be also managed similarly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than software changes. Data also changes! This single pipeline model only assumes there are changes in source code but does not take into account the data changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a content management system - you have live data which changes. You have workflows. Just like software development, it has stages. This is where DataOps arises. How do you manage the workflow between software and data that is also changing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-make-dataops-in-the-spotlight-why-is-it-important-for-businesses&quot;&gt;What make Dataops in the spotlight? Why is it important (for businesses)?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developers have Git and GitHub, and Ops have Jenkins and cloud providers like AWS. We have a lot of exciting tools for software developers and operation managements to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly not so far for data people. Still stuck in SQL that is there forever. No workflows built into the software. Can do merge and testing in the data pipeline. This is basic now in Dev and Ops. But difficult in data. If I want to update a product in e-commerce - how do I do it? Do I do it in a dev environment, test environment, production environment? Need to fit workflow so marketing and others can check and test. Is the content ready to go? Need to model that into data. I can model my workflow with branches and clones. Hard to do the same thing with data. The common workaround is to do it by pushing into the data model itself. It is brittle and hard to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the other problem is. When the software developer developed new features and it requires the changes in schema and data structure for this feature to work. If you only have one production database - how do you do it if it is different from the production version of the software? Now they have achieved by using a series of practices, like migrations, which are scripts that get pushed down the pipeline. Then add or remove versions to match the changed schema. The downside is DB can be offline for a while and it can get messy and fragile. It is a solution, but a bad one! Lack of better tooling. With branch merge and clone, it is all better and easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need a production-like version of my DB for testing. Because we don’t want to test on a production version of DB, we don’t want to break it. Therefore, there’s a need to copy all data to develop environment, which could be a huge and inefficient task in the data set is large. So far most of the tools that we are using are still behind to meet the requirements of these tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-dataops-difference-for-a-data-science-project-and-a-software-development-project&quot;&gt;Is Dataops difference for a data science project and a software development project?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data Science project tends to have more complicated queries, often more complicate schemas as well and perhaps lower velocity of data. The main point about it is not whether it is a data science project or an e-commerce project. It is whether this project has a complicated schema and what is the content velocity and how complicated is the workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My observation is, data science project has a lower content velocity but not always, and maybe with a more complicated schema because what they are doing is more scientifically precise. But I think many of the Dataops can be applied to the data science projects as well. And the property in a data Science team there is a bigger problem in the workflow as they are not working with a Devops environment where they can do some of the practices that I have described. So I can imagine the practices there could be even more ad-hoc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-makes-a-successful-dataops&quot;&gt;What makes a successful Dataops?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like Devops, the goals of Dataops is to eliminating silos and to create cross-functional teams and have full ownership of their tasks and all the capabilities of what they need to do. A successful Dataops team is like a successful Devops team. They are allowed to do what they need to do: have the ability to write software, create infrastructure, as well as to manage data. They got the right mandate and authority to do what they need to do. They are empowered to do what they need to do. And they have all the capacities to do what they need to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-roles-does-dataops-play-in-remote-working&quot;&gt;What roles does Dataops play in remote working?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are building new tools for remote work, they involved data, as well as software, involving Dataops into Devops, would be a good idea as lots of the software engineering works are involved with data. Data are commonly poorly managed. Data can be treated like software, and doing so will require new tools and lots of new practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, data science team need to learn how to do perform Devops practices, how to treat data as code, how to treat schema as code such that they can be populated down the pipeline, can be managed and workflow can be managed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;do-we-need-a-specific-person-in-a-team-to-be-in-charge-of-dataops&quot;&gt;Do we need a specific person in a team to be in-charge of Dataops?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizations can have champions specialist in the practice in, someone who is passioned about moving forward. But I believed in cross-functional teams. In the team, the responsibility should be shared. Need a team that works together to learn a range of relevant skills, to help each other out and share knowledge and understanding of practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;any-insight-about-the-future-of-dataops&quot;&gt;Any insight about the future of DataOps?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is going to be advanced organizations and others that are slower. Ability to process and collaborate on data is a key competitive advantage. If they don’t get the Dataops and Devops right, they will face consequences in the market. Because their competitors will outperform them. These companies will be further along forced by the market. Others in academic and technical settings will have a harder time convincing management to invest in developing the skills and toolsets. Because it is not perceived as critical to advantage in these places. But I think it will be short-sighted. Performing better and better will become more and more important as we go forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;anything-else-you-would-like-to-add&quot;&gt;Anything else you would like to add?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TerminusDB - this is where we think we can make a difference with our software. By providing free and open software that can help with Dataops team, we provide a platform and services that carry the practices that are already common in software development and operations teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are early in our journey and we want people to get on early. We provide free software and we have a very open community that is happy to help you. Please get on board so we can solve real-life problems with our software.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>One Click Deploy TerminusDB to Cloud</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Many people didn’t know that you can deploy TerminusDB easily on cloud. To demonstrate, we have set up &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/terminusdb/terminus-heroku&quot;&gt;this repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/images/terminus-heroku.png&quot; alt=&quot;GitHub repo: terminusdb/terminus-heroku&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a button, which automatically pushes TerminusDB on a Heroku dyno. All you need to do is to fill in an app name and log in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/images/heroku-login.png&quot; alt=&quot;Log in to Heroku&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this repo is meant to be used for people to experiment, try out TerminusDB or for following tutorials. It’s NOT meant for production which you may want more stable cloud cluster set up which let you preserve your data store. (We have productional TerminudDB on cloud for our internal projects).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here you go, we made it easy for you to play around with TerminusDB and do some graph visualisation and analysis. Which tutorials do you want to try out?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

        <title>Our DataOps Meetup at Dublin</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, we have our meetup at the Dogpatch Lab in Dublin. It was the last physical meetup before the COVID-19 semi-lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;but-that-doesnt-stop-us&quot;&gt;But that doesn’t stop us!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a great talk by Gavin, about the importance of DataOps and how to avoid the passing around csvs and renaming everything with the word “final”. Slides of the talk can be found on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/terminusdb/terminusdb-events/blob/master/dublin-meetup/dataops-1st-knowledge-graph/TerminusDB%20-%20The%20Dataops%20Revolution.pdf&quot;&gt;GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of cause, like our London meet up, we will give you a taste of TerminusDB with our first knowledge graph tutorial. People are paying attention and want to try it out. Slides can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://slides.com/cheukting_ho/1st-graph-vis#/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, there’s also a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.terminusdb.com/2020/01/14/my-first-terminusdb-graph-visualisation-bike-share-data/&quot;&gt;blog post as a step by step guide for you&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Stuffing all of Human History into a Single Knowledge Graph</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The history of the world sounds amazing, unimaginably massive. Thanks to academics and scholars, we know a lot about the life of our ancestors and thanks to the progress of technology, we now have lots of open data available on the internet. To gather and organise a knowledge graph covering large-scale human social evolution is a huge challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seshat-global-history-databank&quot;&gt;Seshat: Global History Databank&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Named after the Egyptian goddess of wisdom, knowledge, and writing, &lt;a href=&quot;http://seshatdatabank.info/&quot;&gt;Seshat&lt;/a&gt;, the Global History Databank aims to bring together the most current and comprehensive body of knowledge about human history in one place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers divided the world into a series of Natural Geographic Areas and collected datasets describing all of the specific historical societies or polities that had existed in those areas. By storing the data in a systematic way, different hypotheses about the rise and fall of large-scale societies across the globe and human history can be tested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://seshatdatabank.info/&quot;&gt;http://seshatdatabank.info/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some facts about the data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Academic collaboration seeking to create datasets describing every human society since 10,000BCE&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Major publications in 2018–19 in Nature and PNAS on the evolution of social complexity and religion based on a high-quality RDF DB&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sprawling collection of datasets covering 1000s of variables, mostly human entered and error-prone, with a wide variety of formats and schemata&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2018, the Seshat researchers have released several public datasets — they can be found here. Now, the challenge is, finding a proper tool that can store the databank in a semantic way that let the researchers query, analyse and collaborate with the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;terminusdb-the-git-like-graph-database&quot;&gt;TerminusDB: the Git-like Graph Database&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Named after the Roman God of boundaries, TerminusDB is an open-source database that provides structured, semantically meaningful data for rapid delivery of data-driven applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With TerminusDB’s unified OWL model, a semantic schema can be created to capture all the complex aspects of the Seshat historical data model. Then we can write queries to ingest data to build an integrated knowledge graph. Based on an immutable append-only MVCC in-memory triple-store implemented in a custom rust storage library directed by a Prolog logic engine, it is efficient, safe and allows git like operations — push, pull, clone, merge and branch. With these advantages, multi-mastered cloud databases can be used to build automated pipelines for low-cost data publishing and distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://terminusdb.com/&quot;&gt;https://terminusdb.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these can be achieved easily with WOQL, the Web Object Query Language. It is a powerful language for querying the structure of Terminus Data, it can also be used to construct the schema and load data into the data graph. WOQL is also available in JavaScript client (WOQL.js) and Python client (WOQL.py) which allows programmatic operation of data and smooth integration of analytic and machine learning pipeline and applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/2596/1*Zgpez75_owkbzLoCpCsi0w.png&quot; alt=&quot;A portion of Seshat’s Knowledge Graph showing the evolutionary graph of historical societies&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used WOQL to ingest all of the Seshat data into a great big knowledge graph and then generate graphs showing the evolution of hundreds of different properties of historical societies as they changed over time. The above graph shows all of the global historical timelines in Seshat, with each node representing a polity and the edges showing the ‘successor’ polity, the colour of the nodes represents the presence (green) or absence (red) of professional soldiers in each society. Stay tuned as we will soon be publishing a detailed tutorial showing you how you can build your own knowledge graph using TerminusDB and the Seshat dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>TerminusDB community arrived in London</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We had our first meetup in London last Tuesday at the beautiful Microsoft Reactor located in the centre of the city! Members of the TerminusDB team from Dublin and Berlin came to visit the community. Of course, there were pizzas and lots of beers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We have lots of nice beer at Microsoft Reactor Meetup space, come have some. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/tUsgF5GZCw&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/tUsgF5GZCw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Dmytri Kleiner (@dmytri) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dmytri/status/1227295076218482688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 11, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got so much love for our swags! London Terminators participated and won our e-coffee mugs that made out of bamboo. I hope they will bring them in when buying their morning dose of coffee in their favourite coffee shops. Also, we gave out lots of our Cowduck stickers and T-shirts. Cowduck is winning the heart of Terminators!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Loving the logo and looking forward to learning more &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/TerminusDB?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#TerminusDB&lt;/a&gt; !!!! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/JWKlERYLuU&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/JWKlERYLuU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Ed Outhwaite (@allyrdatarb2us) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/allyrdatarb2us/status/1227307800419864578?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 11, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luke, our Commercial Lead, gave a warm welcome to all the Terminators. He told a story about the origin of Cowduck and announced a competition that you don’t wanna miss (£100 Amazon gift coupon, swags and speaking opportunities!) Make sure you enter before 17th March 2020 (St. Patrick’s Day!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;It is COMPETITION time! 🥳🥳🥳&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use UK Parliament Data with TerminusDB to do something interesting and win prizes! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Details:&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/SEnsncy4Jj&quot;&gt;https://t.co/SEnsncy4Jj&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; TerminusDB (@TerminusDB) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TerminusDB/status/1227592043486158850?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 12, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our BDFL (benevolent dictator for life) Gavin Mendel-Gleason gave a talk about the internals of TerminusDB. It covers a lot of the design that explains why TerminusDB can store data like git and do it in an efficient way. Our Terminators are very interested and asked a lot of questions. Slides can be found here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;und&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We ♥️ &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/London?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#London&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/6rnJYCW1CL&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/6rnJYCW1CL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; TerminusDB (@TerminusDB) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TerminusDB/status/1227311804512161794?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 11, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a short break, we continued with a short workshop in creating a knowledge graph with bike hire data. It was a great success as most of our Terminators has created a graph with no problems! Terminators are smart! In case you missed it or if you want to revisit the tutorial, we have a step by step guide here in &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/terminusdb/my-first-terminusdb-graph-visualisation-bike-share-data-39c59a1ab86a?source=friends_link&amp;amp;sk=2f877df5dcb2f00b9e4e85d5088f015e&quot;&gt;this blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Pretty detailed live workshop for &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TerminusDB?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@TerminusDB&lt;/a&gt; and get to meet all the core devs &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/JhwY3eDsJs&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/JhwY3eDsJs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Steven Lee (@kynrai) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kynrai/status/1227327544044773382?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 11, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Loading data in turtle RDF format to TerminusDB</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;TerminusDB loves RDF! If you have not noticed already, Terminus uses the W3C’s OWL language to define the schema of its databases and OWL is normally encoded as RDFs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loading data in turtle RDF format to TerminusDB is elegant and simple. I assume you have already read our beginner’s tutorial — &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.terminusdb.com/2020/01/14/my-first-terminusdb-graph-visualisation-bike-share-data/&quot;&gt;My First TerminusDB Graph Visualisation&lt;/a&gt; and have been started using &lt;a href=&quot;https://terminusdb.com/&quot;&gt;TerminusDB&lt;/a&gt;. Now you want to load some data in turtle RDF format instead of the csvs like the tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as a revision, when loading the csvs in the tutorial, we use:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;csv&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Start station&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Start_Station&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;End station&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:End_Station&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Start date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Start_Time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;End date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:End_Time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Duration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Duration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Start station number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Start_ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;End station number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:End_ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Bike number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Bike&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Member type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Member_Type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;remote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;https://terminusdb.com/t/data/bike_tutorial.csv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;together with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;wrangles&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;inserts&lt;/code&gt; to load the data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;inputs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;csv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;wrangles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;when&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;inputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;inserts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now, we want to load turtle RDF, so instead of the csv, we can do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;graph://temp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;remote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;my_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;turtle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;quad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Subject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Predicate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;graph://temp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That will read all the turtle data from my_url into a temporary in-memory graph &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;graph://temp&lt;/code&gt; then we can use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;WOQL.when()&lt;/code&gt; to insert the items in the temporary graph to the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example, we are going to load in all the skills in the Language Skills Collection data at ESCO. We downloaded and unzip the file and put the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;lauguage_skills_collection.ttl&lt;/code&gt; in our mounted volume (See &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.terminusdb.com/2020/01/21/loading-your-local-files-in-terminusdb/&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; about how to do it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;create-a-schema-for-the-data&quot;&gt;Create a Schema for the Data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now create a new database and make a query:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;when&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;doctype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;skill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Skills&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Skills extracted from ESCO dataset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now click on the Schema button on the left, we can see that we have created this schema:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/3732/1*GWHcoThbJHtm_KV-pmk67g.png&quot; alt=&quot;Check the schema&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;load-data-to-a-temporary-in-memory-graph-for-inspection&quot;&gt;Load data to a temporary in-memory graph for inspection&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now make a new query:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;limit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;graph://temp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;/app/local_files/language_skills_collection.ttl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
               &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;turtle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;quad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Subject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
               &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Predicate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
               &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
               &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;graph://temp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;limit(50)&lt;/code&gt; to preview the data in the turtle file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/3444/1*BWkFZHpdgraSn3lxxYzD-g.png&quot; alt=&quot;Preview the data&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also make other queries by replacing the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;WOQL.quad()&lt;/code&gt;` above with other queries. For example, we want to grab all the class object, properties of those objects and their types:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;limit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;graph://temp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;/app/local_files/language_skills_collection.ttl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
               &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;turtle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;quad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Class_Obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;graph://temp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;quad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Class_Obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Prop_Obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;graph://temp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;quad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Prop_Obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Prop_Type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;graph://temp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it will give you the following result:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/3444/1*07h4YrOBNiu9i4_SuJ-Vsg.png&quot; alt=&quot;Query result&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if we want to have a closer look at all the property &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://data.europa.eu/esco/model#Skill&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;graph://temp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;/app/local_files/language_skills_collection.ttl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;turtle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;quad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Skill_obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;http://data.europa.eu/esco/model#Skill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;graph://temp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;quad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Skill_obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Skills&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;graph://temp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which shows us all the skills in the data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/3436/1*mlT5VE4NuAfgq1YNS2c6Xw.png&quot; alt=&quot;Closer look of the data&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;insert-data-from-in-memory-graph-to-database&quot;&gt;Insert data from in-memory graph to database&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make the insert query, we will use a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;WOQL.when()&lt;/code&gt; like we did for the csvs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;inputs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;graph://temp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;/app/local_files/language_skills_collection.ttl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;turtle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;quad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Skill_obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;http://data.europa.eu/esco/model#Skill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;graph://temp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;quad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Skill_obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Skills&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;graph://temp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;inserts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;insert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Skill_obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;skill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Skills&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;when&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;inputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;inserts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you see the blue box there you know you have your data in the database:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/2744/1*4JDMv8hAl2nEOQ6Ve8c_uw.png&quot; alt=&quot;Blue box means execute success&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, let’s make a simple query to the database:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;limit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;star&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voila! We have all the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;skills&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/3412/1*qP_TvGUomUYdhhiWdm82qw.png&quot; alt=&quot;Query result&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Loading your local files in TerminusDB</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We have got lot’s of feedback since we have posted our tutorial — &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/terminusdb/my-first-terminusdb-graph-visualisation-bike-share-data-39c59a1ab86a?source=friends_link&amp;amp;sk=2f877df5dcb2f00b9e4e85d5088f015e&quot;&gt;My First TerminusDB Graph Visualisation&lt;/a&gt;. One of the most common questions is how to load a local CSV in the hard drive into your TerminusDB running in a local docker container. So here is how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your container is running stop it with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;./terminusdb-container stop
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Extra tip: you may want to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;./terminusdb-container rm-config&lt;/code&gt; now before you mount the volume. This remove old settings to advoid version conflits that may comes in later if there’s a newer version of Docker image avaliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;set the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;TERMINUSDB_LOCAL&lt;/code&gt; environment variable to the path to the parent directory of your csv:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;export TERMINUSDB_LOCAL=/home/me/somewhere
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;for Windows users:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;export TERMINUSDB_LOCAL=c:/Users/you/somewhere
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Go to Docker Desktop Settings and make sure that the Drive (i.e. ‘C’) your file on is enabled in Shared Drives&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/2474/1*YYgIRufPKRw724nIuWRHzw.png&quot; alt=&quot;Windows setup&quot; /&gt;
Make sure the ‘C’ is clicked and ‘Apply’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then start your container again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;./terminusdb-container run
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;now, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;TERMINUSDB_LOCAL&lt;/code&gt; will be mounted as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/app/local_files&lt;/code&gt;
so, in your WOQL query, you can use:
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.file(/app/local_files/myfilename.csv)&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.remote()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope it helps with lot’s of you who want to load csv locally.
Thanks &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dmytri/status/1219391128287555586&quot;&gt;Dmytri Kleiner&lt;/a&gt; for figuring it out!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Design a Query Language Client for Pythonistas and Data Scientists</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Having an effective yet user-friendly query language is one of the most important aspects of successful database technology. Here at TerminusDB, we aim to provide a good experience to our users whose main language is Python. Enter WOQLpy — a Query Language Client for Pythonistas and Data Scientists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-woqlpy&quot;&gt;What is WOQLpy?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WOQLpy comes with the Terminus Python Client which you can install with pip:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip install terminus-client-python
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example usage:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;woqlclient.woqlClient&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;woql&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;woqlclient&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;WOQLQuery&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;server_url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;http://localhost:6363&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;root&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dbId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;pybike&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;client&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;woql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;WOQLClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;connect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;server_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;createDatabase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dbId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Bicycle Graph&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;station&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;WOQLQuery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;doctype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Station&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Bike Station&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;journey&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;WOQLQuery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;doctype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Journey&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;journey&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;journey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Journey&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;journey&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;journey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;start_station&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Station&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Start Station&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;journey&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;journey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;end_station&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Station&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;End Station&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;schema&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;WOQLQuery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;when&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;woql_and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;station&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;journey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;schema&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complete script can be found in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/terminusdb/terminus-tutorials/tree/master/bike-tutorial/python&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you see, the python client can execute a query created with WOQLpy. It is because WOQLpy lets you build WOQL — the original query language in JSON-LD format with methods in WOQLQuery object and send it to TerminusDB through the Python client. Without WOQLpy, queries need to be written in JSON-LD, for example, the same query above will be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-json highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;challenges-in-design&quot;&gt;Challenges in design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s nice to have WOQLpy, but there are some challenges in adopting WOQL in Python. For example, you may notice that there is a method in the example called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;woql_and&lt;/code&gt;, in WOQL, there are operations that are the same as the Python keywords, to name a few: and, or, not, as, from. In this case, we added the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;woql_&lt;/code&gt; prefix to make it valid in Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another challenge is, as many of the methods we allow provide for more that one way of input, for example, with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.label&lt;/code&gt; we allow users to input just a string “Journey” or a dictionary {“@value”: “Journey”, “@language”: “en”}, we have to do lots of checking in handling different user inputs. But it is totally worth it as we believe it will give a better usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;make-it-better-for-data-scientist&quot;&gt;Make it better for Data Scientist&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are still at the beginning of our journey to make TerminusDB super useful for data scientists. One of the features that we have in mind to implement is to make our &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/terminusdb/my-first-terminusdb-graph-visualisation-bike-share-data-39c59a1ab86a?source=friends_link&amp;amp;sk=2f877df5dcb2f00b9e4e85d5088f015e&quot;&gt;cool graph visualization&lt;/a&gt; embedded in Jupyter notebook. Right now it is possible to be embedded to websites thanks to our Javascript client. We should be able to do that same to Jupyter notebook for Python client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, we think it would be nice to have a direct io with pandas data frame instead of passing it with csvs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TerminusDB is open-source, we would like to invite you to try it out and give us feedback and ideas. Please feel free to join the slack channel and chat with the team: &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/terminusdb-slack&quot;&gt;http://bit.ly/terminusdb-slack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Are you supporting the right politician?</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;terminusdb-graph-visualisation-of-dublin-council-voting-data&quot;&gt;TerminusDB graph visualisation of Dublin Council voting data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you ever check to see the actual voting record of your preferred politician before you vote? Or, do you just vote for them because of their party affiliation? Do you think your local representative speaks for you on the issues that you care about?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Politics can be complicated, my friend, but data never lies. In this tutorial, we will use TerminusDB to show you how to analyse the voting behavior of politicians. For demonstration purposes we’ll use a dataset describing the voting records of Councillors in Dublin City Council, the birthplace of TerminusDB, retrieved from &lt;a href=&quot;https://counciltracker.ie/&quot;&gt;https://counciltracker.ie/&lt;/a&gt;, the cleaned data used in the tutorial can be &lt;a href=&quot;https://terminusdb.com/t/data/council/weighted_similarity.csv&quot;&gt;downloaded here&lt;/a&gt;. (Thanks &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dublininquirer.com/&quot;&gt;Dublin Inquirer&lt;/a&gt; for the great work — have to keep the politicians on their toes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll use WOQL, the web object query language, a powerful and highly composable graph query language, throughout the tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(We’re assuming you already have TerminusDB installed, but if you haven’t go to our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/terminusdb/terminus-quickstart&quot;&gt;quick start installation guide&lt;/a&gt;. It’s very easy to get started.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;create-a-database-and-a-schema&quot;&gt;Create a Database and a Schema&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a Database in the +Create Database link on the left hand side of the terminus-console. You could call it &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dublin_council&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/3608/1*_40iXp2ntk6WD2ACNmm_nQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;create database&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once it is created, go to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Query&lt;/code&gt; link on the left, and enter the following query:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;when&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;doctype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Party&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Party&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Political Party&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;doctype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Representative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Representative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;An elected member of the Dublin Council&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;member_of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Party&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;doctype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Similarity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Similarity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;similarity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;decimal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Similarity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;similar_to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Representative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Similar To&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;cardinality&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and click &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Submit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a quick check to make sure the schema is there. Click Schema in the left hand navigation bar and you should have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/2758/1*9PE_cpKZDIMAX9Fz7OPjbw.png&quot; alt=&quot;classes in a schema&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you click the graph view button (circled in red), you should see:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/2772/1*-e_HmFelPXAW5FHn9QRJgg.png&quot; alt=&quot;graph of classes in schema&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the query above, we created 3 &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;doctype&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Party&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Representative&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Similarity&lt;/code&gt;. Regarding the property, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Representative&lt;/code&gt; is the member of 1 &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Party&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Similarity&lt;/code&gt; will consist of a decimal number and linking up 2 &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Representative&lt;/code&gt;. We created the schema using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;when()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, we need &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;csv&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;wrangles&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;inserts&lt;/code&gt; to load in the data. We’re going to use the query to import the data, clean it and match it. As you might have seen in other TerminusDB tutorials, WOQL is a highly composable language, you can combine queries arbitrarily using logical ANDs and ORs.
Make a new WOQL query as follow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;csv&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;similar_to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Rep_A_ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;similar_to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Rep_B_ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;similarity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Similarity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;inputs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;csv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;wrangles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;when&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;inputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;inserts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and click &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Submit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the csv we load in all the relevant columns of the csv and link them with a variable identified with v: using as()&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the wrangles we have to do data wrangling operations, idgen() for creating id for fields and typecast() to cast the Distance column in to a decimal objects as Similarity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our inputs are now ready (created by csv and wrangles)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the inserts, we actually slot the objects in, the variables created in the wrangles will be insert() with an id. We can also add label(), descriptions() and property()&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Load the data using another when()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the data in TerminusDB, you can now click on the documents and explore. It should look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/3502/1*sZD377lF0PbSoZ-P3ttQJw.png&quot; alt=&quot;documents of the database&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can then click on a party to explore further — click on the Green Party for example and you can see their members:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/2782/1*J5uLs4-mVvuiOA7xtl6QFw.png&quot; alt=&quot;members of Green party&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then click on Patrick Costello and you get his similarity scoring with the other members of the council:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/2812/1*86Xpjqr4HTCo4ViW36aT5g.png&quot; alt=&quot;similarity of Patrick Costello&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can quickly see the similarities across the Councillors. Substituting products for people, it’s easy to see how a similar process could build a recommendation engine for e-commerce or another service. We’ll put those additional steps in the next TerminusDB tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click on one of the others at random and you get this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/2806/1*UaRyfHoX9i9S4A-0xRnE0A.png&quot; alt=&quot;similarity between Patrick Costello and Rebecca Moynihan&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is a high similarity score (0.854) for Councillors from different parties (Rebecca Moynihan is in the Labour Party).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;query-and-visualisation&quot;&gt;Query and Visualisation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now with the schema and data in place, we can build some queries and visualise the outputs as a graph. First we have to create a query (of course):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;limit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;triple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Subject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;similar_to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;triple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Subject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;similar_to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Value2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;triple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Subject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;similarity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Similarity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;triple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;member_of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Party&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;triple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Value2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;member_of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Party2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;eq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Value2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;opt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;triple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Value2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Lab2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;opt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;triple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Lab1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;eval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;divide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;exp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Similarity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Distance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and click &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Submit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;WOQL.limiti(1000).and&lt;/code&gt; to limit the result set and shorten the query time (we’ll show the full scaled up results later)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This query only uses &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;triple()&lt;/code&gt; not &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;quad()&lt;/code&gt; we are only extracting data from a single database (including &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;quad()&lt;/code&gt; allows you to specify which databases you want to extract data from)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;opt()&lt;/code&gt; to ignore the missing objects (instead of returning an error)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;eval()&lt;/code&gt; to execute arithmetic calculation (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;divide()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;exp()&lt;/code&gt;) and store it to variable &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Distance&lt;/code&gt;, this variable is calculated from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Similarty&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will now have results in a tabular form below the query:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/2734/1*0HeHCKMDGalsg0lnPaBB-w.png&quot; alt=&quot;query result in a table&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hard to make sense out of the result! But at least we see we have results from our query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make a graph visualisation, click on the graph button (the right most of the 3 at the top right of the table):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/1988/1*xF6c0AhuC7J6OwNDwbAEvQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;a messy graph&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow! What is this madness! As we have show everything from the query: every object, every property, label, description… things are a little too busy to make visual sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to customize the view of the graph. Click on the left most button of the 3 at the top right, you will see an extra input field for the view:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/3196/1*lN10ba9auHPi-0VAS7nlzg.png&quot; alt=&quot;view pane&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replace everything with our customised view script:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Update view&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We hidden() some node()&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Customize the edge() to have the distance() equal to the variable Distance and have a equal weight() of 0.04. It will also show the value of Distance when mouse on&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Replace the icon() with the label() of Lab, which is the name of the politicians.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;charge() and collisionRadius() makes the nodes have a natual seperation with each other (avoid clustering) for easier viewing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💥now we have a much nicer graph:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/1740/1*CAZV-VB2EKsmE1GMfBwigw.png&quot; alt=&quot;nicer graph&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait, are we missing something? Oh, the party of the politicians, let’s colour code the politicians to their party so we can make easy sense of the graph. Let’s edit the view again with this script:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;view&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Value2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Party2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;doc:PartyWorkers'%20Party&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;225&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;225&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;225&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the script is a bit long, but it is not complicated. For example, if the politician has &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Party&lt;/code&gt; equal to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PartyGreen Party&lt;/code&gt; (%20 for white space), colour the node [225, 225, 125] which is light green (matching the colour code from the source website):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/2364/1*DUyqby2Oq7MrZjkPgnlrXw.png&quot; alt=&quot;colour code of different parties from counciltracker.ie&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same also apply to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Lab2&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Party2&lt;/code&gt; (and they are just the parallel image of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Lab&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Party&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s try to see the whole picture by removing the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;limit(1000&lt;/code&gt;) from our query and click &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;submit&lt;/code&gt;. (Warning: you need memory for handling the graphics and it might take a few seconds to load).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/1710/1*1tFXtXdoeOAMMxAYvVGt9A.png&quot; alt=&quot;completed graph&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some really interesting conclusions we can quickly draw from viewing the data in this way. Specifically, the data allows us to draw the following conclusions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Political parties do tend to vote in a reasonably homogeneous fashion (the distribution is not random, or anything close to it)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sinn Fein enjoy the strongest disciplinary record in terms of council votes, with all Councillors clustered closely together&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fine Gael and Fianna Fail are heavily inter-mingled, to the extent that they could almost be considered a single party&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The same could be said for the Green Party and Labour Party, who present as a single block in this analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These results are interesting in and of themselves. But in addition, the visualisation of data in this way enables us to see a continuum across the political spectrum, and accurately place parties on that spectrum based on real data rather than perception or prejudice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly this data shows clearly the politics of any given independent just by looking which parties they are situated with. A few independents seem to occupy an equivalent status to Sinn Féin or Fianna Fáil-Fine Gael. A few hover around the Solidarity-People-Before Profit-Workers’ Party nexus. However, the voting positions of the Greens and Labour are not apparently so popular with the unaffiliated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it is your turn. Change the parameters in the view script to play around and mix things up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more thing to do is to analyse different dataset. Here is some open data from the US Congress that you can play around, and a quick WOQL query to build the schema:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;when&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;doctype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Party&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Party&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

        <title>Storing data like git — TerminusDB</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I have been to a meetup where a team of software developers from Dublin talks about their newest invention — &lt;a href=&quot;https://terminusdb.com/&quot;&gt;TerminusDB&lt;/a&gt;, a graph database that stores data like git. My reaction was like, what? Imagine all the cool things you can do with git: time travel, branching and forking etc, you can do them with your data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s more, TerminusDB is a graph database, meaning all data are stored in nodes and edges, makes it easy to extract relations between your data without all the hideous joins in relational SQL database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, let’s talk about the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is a graph&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How git works&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How TerminusDB works&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-a-graph&quot;&gt;What is a graph?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In mathematics, a graph is a structure amounting to a set of objects in which some pairs of the objects are in some sense “related”. The objects correspond to mathematical abstractions called nodes and each of the related pairs of vertices is called an edge [&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common type of graphs is directed graphs and undirected graphs. The difference is, the edges of a directed graph have direction from a node to another but the edges of an undirected graph do not — it just linked two nodes together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of our data can be stored in a graph, and the usage of graph databases are more than what you think: knowledge graph in Google and NASA, recommendation engines, fraud detection in financial services, machine learning using graphs in deep learning and AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/0*iOO7eoc9T2h1wt2u.png&quot; alt=&quot;recommendation via knowledge graph&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-git-works&quot;&gt;How git works&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who have not used git/ not familiar with git, let’s quickly recap how git works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/2026/0*R9RZrgyWQFMfSNae.png&quot; alt=&quot;explaining how git works&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you make changes in the repo, you will have to add your changes in the staging area, then you commit it. Git will store the new content and keep different commit as a series of events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/1600/0*pooMsU1ggBkhzBjK.png&quot; alt=&quot;get commit tree&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fun fact here, counter-intuitively, git does not store diff. Instead, it makes files into blobs and stores repo as a tree of pointers pointing to the blobs. It also stores the commits in sequences so it stores the history of the repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-terminusdb-works&quot;&gt;How TerminusDB works&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we see how similar TerminusDB is storing data in a chain of commits, layers in this case, just like git. However, it stores the diff instead (can see it having advantage in having a huge amount of data). For each layer, data, as a triplet consists of the edge and the nodes that it links, is stored either on the +ve plane or -ve plane (except the initial layer as everything was created).+ve means new data is added and -ve means that data is deleted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/1920/1*5Tww22yWeosH4T8UdwXq8w.gif&quot; alt=&quot;how TerminusDB works&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you make a query, you search from the most recent layer (the HEAD layer) back, if it is found in the +ve plane, it exists in the database; if it is found in the -ve plane, it existed at some point in time but was deleted so it can be concluded that does not exist anymore in the database. If it is not found on either, it goes one commit back and does the same thing until hitting the initial layer which finding the data or not can conclude whether it exists in the database or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/1920/1*sRDGALZFqc19jRhtyHl0Bw.gif&quot; alt=&quot;how TerminudDB stores data&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making changes to the data in the database is like making a new commit in git. Internally, a layer builder would build the +ve and -ve plane (except the initial layer of cause) and then commit it to the series of layers, moving the HEAD forward. This makes time travel as simple as moving the HEAD just like git. Also, imagine you can make a new branch and create more layers and merge it back to the master branch.
There’s so much potential in this genius design. I am already thinking about how this can give lot’s of advantage in processing data. I have talked to the team and they are super nice. As the product is quite new, they are happy to answer questions or hear feedback from you. Here are their contact details:&lt;/p&gt;
