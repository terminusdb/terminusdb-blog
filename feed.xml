        <title>Why Graph Will Win</title>
        <description>
            
            <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2540/1*qa--bW5-ntB1BRuCcigiYQ.png" alt="cover image"/>
            
            
            &lt;p&gt;I recently published a warts-and-all 4 part introduction (covering &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/09/20/graph-fundamentals-part-1-rdf/&quot;&gt;RDF&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/09/25/graph-fundamentals-part-2-labelled-property-graphs/&quot;&gt;Property Graphs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/02/25/graph-fundamentals-part-4-linked-data/&quot;&gt;Graph Schemas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/02/25/graph-fundamentals-part-4-linked-data/&quot;&gt;Linked Data&lt;/a&gt;). You would be forgiven for concluding that I am not a fan of Graph databases or RDF. One reader on Twitter even accused me of “shitting on RDF”(!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to be frank about the problems of graphs and RDF and not just whistle the marketing tune because as soon as the technology is out there in the hands of developers, they &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; find the problems and will be inclined to reject the technology as pure hype if all they have heard are songs of breathless wonder. In the last couple of years, while trying to sell graph databases into bricks and mortar companies, by far the most hostile reactions I’ve come across have been from technologists who got bitten by the Semantic Web bug in the early 2000s. Once bitten twice shy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you were to assume that I’m a critic of graph databases, you would be very wrong. I’ve spent most of the last decade building graph database management systems because to me it’s incredibly obvious that in the long run graph is going to win and here’s why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point of all databases is to provide as accurate a representation of some aspect of external reality as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fundamental advantage of graph databases is that they model the world as things that have properties and relationships with other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is closer to the way that humans perceive the world — mapping between whatever aspect of external reality you are interested in and the data model is an order of magnitude easier than with relational databases. Everything is pre-joined — you don’t have to disassemble objects into normalised tables and reassemble them with joins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And because creating and curating large and complex datasets is very difficult, very expensive and potentially very lucrative, the reduction in technical complexity in creating and interpreting the graph data model is irresistible. The knowledge graphs that companies like Google and Facebook have accumulated are demonstrably commercially powerful and it is unlikely that such complex and rich datasets would have been possible without graph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans have an evolutionarily pragmatic view of the world. We perceive the world as things that move through space and time. These things have properties which may change over time. They also have relationships with other things which may also change over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The model is simple but there are a great many different types of things — from stones, to mirrors to politicians and honeybees. To make sense of these things and their properties, we organise them into types and organise these types into a ‘tree-of-life’ or more broadly a ‘tree-of-things’ —taxonomies of types of things that share certain properties and relationships with other types of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you are building a database to record the known universe or logging network security incidents, the model that you actually want to record is always a bunch of objects, categorised with a type-taxonomy, with properties and relationships with other objects, some of which change over time. That’s what you always want to record, because that’s how you perceive the world. Any indirection between perceived world and recorded model creates extra complexity at every step of processing. And in the world of complex systems, combinatorial explosion of complexity is the one true enemy. Reducing the complexity in each and every data operation is irresistible in the long run — you can focus on other things rather than the mappings between the aspects of the real world that you want to model and their stored representations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this respect, even the simplest graph database such as Neo4j — which models the world as a bunch of JSON documents, some of which may contain pointers to other JSON documents, is much better than even the fanciest RDBMS. Granted there is no taxonomy or schema, and support for temporality is basic, but it’s easy to produce a much more naturalistic model of the world than will ever be possible if you have to break the things up into relations. Of course it is possible to automate this mapping by delegating the problem to code (for example by using ORMs or system meta-models) but this is a short-term fix that blows up as size and complexity increase. Code has unbounded complexity and is largely opaque to automated analysis —its contribution to combinatorial explosion becomes overwhelming at scale. All systems which are built upon ORMs evolve into ORM maintenance systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The diagram below shows how different database technologies rank in terms of their data-modelling power — the extent to which they allow you to create naturalistic models of the world. To briefly explain the categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/2540/1*qa--bW5-ntB1BRuCcigiYQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;comparing databases&quot; /&gt;
Databases ranked by data modelling power with leading open source examples of each type (in database land, if you are not open source, you have no long term future )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;key-value-stores-and-wide-column-stores&quot;&gt;Key Value Stores and Wide Column Stores&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These databases exist primarily to provide computer programs with somewhere to save the variables that they use — they lack data-modelling features beyond basic datatypes. There is nothing wrong with this — computer programs need databases too. It is also, of course, possible to assemble complex data-models from these atomic units within programs, but this very quickly runs into the combinatorial explosion problem — almost everything is described in code leading to unbridled complexity growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;document-stores&quot;&gt;Document Stores&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Document stores typically store data as a set of JSON documents —objects with tree-structures. The big feature of these databases over relational is that these documents are suitable for creating naturalistic models of things, with the tree structure expressing a containment (or has-a) relationship type. However, they are severely crippled because of poor support for modelling relationships — document relations are often expressed through embedding duplicates of other documents — a horrible, awful, solution which massively increases complexity over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;relational-databases&quot;&gt;Relational Databases&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relational databases are all about relations — tables that can be joined together to formed new relations. Foreign keys are used to express schematic relationships between tables. These relationships are untyped and semantically meaningless integers or strings are commonly used as keys. As a result relational databases are fairly impoverished in terms of their abilities to capture real world relationships — we can’t distinguish between containment (has-a) and other types of relationships so we can’t actually turn these relations back into objects without information that is external to the system — mostly in glue code or ORMs. Furthermore, translating to and from these relations and real world objects is rather intricate and leads to a very complex data model even for relatively simple aspects of the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;property-graphs&quot;&gt;Property Graphs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Property graphs are basically document stores with a dash of relations added in that is to say, they are just a bunch of JSONs with some properties acting as special links to other JSONs (the in and out properties of edges). Even though they are quite primitive, they still have the most important features needed to create naturalistic models of the real world — things (nodes) with properties and relationships (edges).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rdf-graphs&quot;&gt;RDF Graphs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RDF graphs have all of the features of the database models to the left, the thing that they really bring to the party is the concept of object types — via the &lt;em&gt;rdf:type&lt;/em&gt; predicate — and not just simple datatypes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;owl-graphs&quot;&gt;OWL Graphs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graph databases that use the Web Ontology Language (OWL) to describe their data model are by far the most powerful in terms of data modelling capabilities, although OWL must be used with care as it can easily lead to an incomprehensibly complex data model (and in practice we need to choose a computable fragment of the language). Nevertheless, the really important aspects can be boiled down to 3 simple predicates that enable relationships between object types to be defined — &lt;em&gt;rdfs:domain&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;rdfs:range&lt;/em&gt; support strongly typed relationships between objects, not just simple relationships, while &lt;em&gt;rdfs:subClassOf&lt;/em&gt; supports type inheritance — and hence proper taxonomies — these combine to provide a fully featured type system, the holy grail of data modelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, while some people may feel that recent interest in graph databases is just another fad, I’m putting my money on graph — 20 years from now, non-graph databases will be niche and legacy applications.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Stuffing all of Human History into a Single Knowledge Graph</title>
        <description>
            
            
            <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2110/1*2Cm8rFu45ogPIm8C6fsnXg.png" alt="cover image"/>
            
            &lt;p&gt;The history of the world sounds amazing, unimaginably massive. Thanks to academics and scholars, we know a lot about the life of our ancestors and thanks to the progress of technology, we now have lots of open data available on the internet. To gather and organise a knowledge graph covering large-scale human social evolution is a huge challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seshat-global-history-databank&quot;&gt;Seshat: Global History Databank&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Named after the Egyptian goddess of wisdom, knowledge, and writing, &lt;a href=&quot;http://seshatdatabank.info/&quot;&gt;Seshat&lt;/a&gt;, the Global History Databank aims to bring together the most current and comprehensive body of knowledge about human history in one place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers divided the world into a series of Natural Geographic Areas and collected datasets describing all of the specific historical societies or polities that had existed in those areas. By storing the data in a systematic way, different hypotheses about the rise and fall of large-scale societies across the globe and human history can be tested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://seshatdatabank.info/&quot;&gt;http://seshatdatabank.info/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some facts about the data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Academic collaboration seeking to create datasets describing every human society since 10,000BCE&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Major publications in 2018–19 in Nature and PNAS on the evolution of social complexity and religion based on a high-quality RDF DB&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sprawling collection of datasets covering 1000s of variables, mostly human entered and error-prone, with a wide variety of formats and schemata&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2018, the Seshat researchers have released several public datasets — they can be found here. Now, the challenge is, finding a proper tool that can store the databank in a semantic way that let the researchers query, analyse and collaborate with the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;terminusdb-the-git-like-graph-database&quot;&gt;TerminusDB: the Git-like Graph Database&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Named after the Roman God of boundaries, TerminusDB is an open-source database that provides structured, semantically meaningful data for rapid delivery of data-driven applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With TerminusDB’s unified OWL model, a semantic schema can be created to capture all the complex aspects of the Seshat historical data model. Then we can write queries to ingest data to build an integrated knowledge graph. Based on an immutable append-only MVCC in-memory triple-store implemented in a custom rust storage library directed by a Prolog logic engine, it is efficient, safe and allows git like operations — push, pull, clone, merge and branch. With these advantages, multi-mastered cloud databases can be used to build automated pipelines for low-cost data publishing and distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://terminusdb.com/&quot;&gt;https://terminusdb.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these can be achieved easily with WOQL, the Web Object Query Language. It is a powerful language for querying the structure of Terminus Data, it can also be used to construct the schema and load data into the data graph. WOQL is also available in JavaScript client (WOQL.js) and Python client (WOQL.py) which allows programmatic operation of data and smooth integration of analytic and machine learning pipeline and applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/2596/1*Zgpez75_owkbzLoCpCsi0w.png&quot; alt=&quot;A portion of Seshat’s Knowledge Graph showing the evolutionary graph of historical societies&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used WOQL to ingest all of the Seshat data into a great big knowledge graph and then generate graphs showing the evolution of hundreds of different properties of historical societies as they changed over time. The above graph shows all of the global historical timelines in Seshat, with each node representing a polity and the edges showing the ‘successor’ polity, the colour of the nodes represents the presence (green) or absence (red) of professional soldiers in each society. Stay tuned as we will soon be publishing a detailed tutorial showing you how you can build your own knowledge graph using TerminusDB and the Seshat dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Graph Fundamentals — Part 4: Linked Data</title>
        <description>
            
            <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2508/1*jjM9YCuvUtaymfkPA787oQ.png" alt="cover image"/>
            
            
            &lt;p&gt;This is the fourth and final installment in this series, you can find the first 3 episodes here: &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/09/20/graph-fundamentals-part-1-rdf/&quot;&gt;Part 1: RDF&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/09/25/graph-fundamentals-part-2-labelled-property-graphs/&quot;&gt;Part 2: Property Graphs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/02/25/graph-fundamentals-part-4-linked-data/&quot;&gt;Part 3: Graph Schemas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the mid 2000s, it was clear that the vision of the semantic web, as set out by Tim Berners Lee in 2001, despite a huge amount of initial hype and investment, remained largely unrealized. The basic idea — that a network of machine readable, semantically rich documents would form a ‘semantic web’ much like the world wide web of documents, was proving much more difficult than had been anticipated. This prompted the emergence of the concept of ‘linked data’, again promoted by Tim Berners Lee, and laid out in two documents published in 2006 and 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linked data was, in essence, an attempt to reduce the idea of the semantic web down to a small number of simple principles, which were meant to capture the core of the semantic web without being overly prescriptive over the details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 4 basic principles were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use URIs for things&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use HTTP URIs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make these HTTP URIs dereferencable, returning useful information about the thing referred to&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Include links to other URIs to allow discovery of more things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can supplement these 4 principles with a fifth, which was originally defined as a ‘best practice’ but which effectively became a core principle:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“People should use terms from well-known RDF vocabularies such as FOAF, SIOC, SKOS, DOAP, vCard, Dublin Core to make it easier for client applications to process Linked Data”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These 5 points effectively defined linked data movement and remain at the heart of current semantic web research. 1 and 4 are encapsulated within RDF (linked data was not defined to mean only RDF but, in practice, RDF is almost always used by people publishing linked data), they were just restating the basic design ideas of the semantic web with a less prescriptive approach. The second principle just recognised that, in practice, people only ever really used HTTP URLs — by 2006, HTTP had become the dominant mechanism for communicating with remote servers, as it remains today — so this was very sensible. So far so good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 3rd principle was also restating a concept that had been implicit in RDF and the semantic web — the idea that if you submit a HTTP GET to any of the URLs used in linked data, you should get useful information about the thing that is being referred to. So, for example, if you have a triple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;prefix ex &amp;lt;http://my.url/&amp;gt;
ex:jane ex:likes ex:chocalate
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you open http://my.url/jane in your browser, the server should return some useful information about jane, while if you open http://my.url/likes , you should get useful information about the ‘likes’ concept. This principle means that linked data can be ‘self-documenting’ — because each concept used has documentation that can be found at the given URL, giving us a simple and well-known mechanism for knowing where to find the documentation of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the big problem is that this principle is too weak — it does not dictate what the useful information is, what it should contain or what services it should support. It should really contain a machine-readable definition of the term, not just unspecified useful information. Without that stipulation, we can’t really automate much — we don’t know what type of information will be found at any given URL, or even what format it will be in. A human has to look at it to interpret it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then when we come to the fifth and final principle — the reuse of popular vocabulary terms — things really get messy. The motivation for this principle is clear, everybody was creating their own ontologies with their own classes and properties, reinventing the wheel again and again rather than reusing existing ontologies. Surely, it would be better if people reused the same terms rather than reinventing their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the big problem is that the well-known ontologies and vocabularies such as foaf and dublin-core that have been reused, cannot really be used as libraries in such a manner. They lack precise and correct definitions and they are full of errors and mutual inconsistencies [1] and they themselves use terms from other ontologies — creating huge and unwieldy dependency trees. If, for example, we want to use the foaf ontology as a library, we need to also include several dozen dependant libraries, some of which no longer exist. So, the linked data approach, in fact, just uses these terms as untyped tags — there is no clear and usable definition of what any of these terms actually mean — people just bung in whatever they want — creating a situation where there are effectively no reliable semantics to any of these terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/2508/1*jjM9YCuvUtaymfkPA787oQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;The dependency tree of the open annotations ontology — typical of a linked data vocabulary&quot; /&gt;
The dependency tree of the open annotations ontology — typical of a linked data vocabulary&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://lod-cloud.net/&quot;&gt;Linked Open Data Cloud&lt;/a&gt; is the great achievement of the linked data movement — it shows a vast array of interconnected datasets, incorporating many of the most important and well known resources on the internet such as wikipedia. Unfortunately, however, on closer examination, it is far less impressive and useful than it might appear — due to the lack of well-defined common semantics across these datasets, the links are little more than links — they cannot be automatically interpreted by computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s worse, where semantic terms are used, they are very often used erroneously. For example, it is commonplace to use the term &lt;em&gt;owl:sameAs&lt;/em&gt; to create links between instances in different datasets that are about the same real world thing and likewise it is common to use the term &lt;em&gt;owl:equivalentClass&lt;/em&gt; to refer to classes that refer to the same real world thing. In these cases, while the terms are well-defined, their defined meanings are quite different to how they are actually used — they assert that the classes or instances are logically the same thing and can be unified. If we follow the correct interpretation, the consequence is that everything blows up because they are almost never in fact logically equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that such links are useless —it is manifestly useful to a human engaged in a data-integration task to know which data-structures are about the same real-world thing - but that falls far short of the vision of the semantic web — it is supposed to be a web of knowledge for machines, not humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fundamentally decentralised conception of linked data carries further challenges. It take resources to create, curate and maintain high quality datasets and if we don’t continue to feed a dataset with resources, entropy quickly takes over. If we want to build an application that relies upon a third party linked dataset, we are relying upon whoever publishes that dataset to continue to feed it with resources — this is a risky bet in general and particularly risky when we are dealing with academic research in which almost all resources are focused on novelty and almost none on infrastructure and maintenance. For example, the wordnet linked dataset has been extensively used in commercial applications, but the dataset maintainers at the University of Southampton have long since run out of resources to maintain it [2]. The semantic web — as illustrated in the diagram above — is predictably littered with abandoned ontologies and datasets. Simply continuing to build linked datasets without considering the resourcing problem is building on foundations of sand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, the linked data movement as it exists suffers from several critical problems which continue to prevent adoption outside of academic research. Firstly, the specifications are too weak to enable automatic processing by machines in any meaningful way. Secondly, it creates dependencies on third parties without any sustainable economic model. Even in a perfect world without free-riders, there are many situations in which a third party might be getting much more value from a dataset than the dataset maintainer who bears the cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we actually want to make linked data and the semantic web work the first thing that we need to do is to radically reduce the ambition of the movement. Firstly, we should only create links between datasets that have well defined, sound and mutually compatible machine-readable semantics. Secondly, we should resource the maintenance of high-quality datasets as a public service, rather than leave them subject to the novelty-loving whims of academic research.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>TerminusDB @ PyLadies Dublin</title>
        <description>

            &lt;p&gt;Hello Terminators!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A first — for me at least — attending PyLadies, Dublin!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PyLadies helps more women become active participants and leaders in the Python open-source community. PyLadies Dublin also provides a friendly support network for women and a bridge to the larger Python world. Anyone with an interest in Python is encouraged to participate. You can see more &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/PyLadiesDublin/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; — we really enjoyed, so I’d encourage people to attend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TerminusDB Developer Advocate Extraordinaire, Cheuk, spoke at the PyLadies event earlier this week. There were about 40 PyLadies in the audience and a sprinkling of interloping PyMen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/9216/1*TyLh-oQIByoTjJ37rR3HzQ.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;PyLadiesDublin meetup&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event took place in the Dublin office of Qualtrics, which has a full replica of an Irish pub. Another good reason to attend!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheuk used TerminusDB to ask if we are supporting the correct politician. She used data from the Dublin City Council. It is a fascinating use case, and relevant in Ireland as we have just had an inconclusive election (and might have another in the not too distant future). There is a run through of the demo &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/01/15/are-you-supporting-the-right-politician/&quot;&gt;over here&lt;/a&gt; — give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full video of the excellent presentation is here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TerminusDB is open source now and forever so it is perfect for the Python community. We are rolling out ever more features for Pythonistas — check out our &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/01/20/design-a-query-language-client-for-pythonistas-and-data-scientists/&quot;&gt;python query client&lt;/a&gt;! And watch this space for exciting news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll keep you up to date with reports from TerminusDB talks and events. A veritable Terminator news service.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Terminalia — Our Day</title>
        <description>
            
            <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1658/0*ArjA9ORibKUVEZFP.jpeg" alt="cover image"/>
            
            
            &lt;p&gt;The end of the year approaches. This Sunday 23 February we celebrate Terminalia — the festival that marks the end of the Old Roman Year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TerminusDB is named after the Roman God of boundaries, Terminus — all databases need good boundaries — and Terminalia is his festival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/1658/0*ArjA9ORibKUVEZFP.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;We want the finest wines available to humanity!&quot; /&gt;
We want the finest wines available to humanity!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terminus is an old Roman god — probably introduced by Romulus after the founding of the city. There is a famous story told of the last king of Rome, Tarquin (so disliked &amp;amp; proud that he was overthrown and the Republic declared) — he wanted to reshape Rome as an imperial capital and engaged in a large scale building programme. As part of his works, he set about reconstructing the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitol Hill. Tarquin thought that constructing a massive temple over the remains of a holy site consecrated by Romulus would cement his place as a great King of Rome. To facilitate the reconstruction, the older shrines to various gods had to be removed; however, when they attempted to move the shrine of Terminus, it would not budge. Terminus was the immovable rock of the Capitol. Even Jupiter, the king of the gods, had to kneel to Terminus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/terminusdb/terminusdb-whats-in-a-name-27b8be6b0794&quot;&gt;More on Terminus and TerminusDB’s name.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terminus’ slogan &lt;em&gt;‘Concedo Nulli’&lt;/em&gt; — concede to nobody — remains at the heart of the TerminusDB project. We continue to walk through walls to get the features out the door. We will not yield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/3792/0*QpWPQjM2KyznDjeD.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;statue of Terminus&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terminalia is the official holiday for TerminusDB. As it’s on a Sunday this year, we celebrate tonight. As Ovid dictates, we will allow the pagan spirits to flow. We will pour lamb’s blood on the statue of Terminus and offer him suckling pigs and wine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/2600/0*u1Y5gT-CQ3_Fx6bz.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;painting of Terminalia&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When night has passed, let the god be celebrated With customary honour, who separates the fields with his sign. Terminus, whether a stone or a stump buried in the earth, You have been a god since ancient times. You are crowned from either side by two landowners, Who bring two garlands and two cakes in offering. An altar’s made: here the farmer’s wife herself Brings coals from the warm hearth on a broken pot. The old man cuts wood and piles the logs with skill, And works at setting branches in the solid earth. Then he nurses the first flames with dry bark, While a boy stands by and holds the wide basket. When he’s thrown grain three times into the fire The little daughter offers the sliced honeycombs. Others carry wine: part of each is offered to the flames: The crowd, dressed in white, watch silently. Terminus, at the boundary, is sprinkled with lamb’s blood, And doesn’t grumble when a sucking pig is granted him. Neighbours gather sincerely, and hold a feast, And sing your praises, sacred Terminus: ‘You set bounds to peoples, cities, great kingdoms: Without you every field would be disputed. You curry no favour: you aren’t bribed with gold, Guarding the land entrusted to you in good faith. If you’d once marked the bounds of Thyrean lands, Three hundred men would not have died, Nor Othryades’ name be seen on the pile of weapons. O how he made his fatherland bleed! What happened when the new Capitol was built? The whole throng of gods yielded to Jupiter and made room: But as the ancients tell, Terminus remained in the shrine Where he was found, and shares the temple with great Jupiter. Even now there’s a small hole in the temple roof, So he can see nothing above him but stars. Since then, Terminus, you’ve not been free to wander: Stay there, in the place where you’ve been put, And yield not an inch to your neighbour’s prayers, Lest you seem to set men above Jupiter: And whether they beat you with rakes, or ploughshares, Call out: “This is your field, and that is his!”’ There’s a track that takes people to the Laurentine fields, The kingdom once sought by Aeneas, the Trojan leader: The sixth milestone from the City, there, bears witness To the sacrifice of a sheep’s entrails to you, Terminus. The lands of other races have fixed boundaries: The extent of the City of Rome and the world is one.” — Ovid, Fasti II&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/the-other-marching-season-terminalia-the-roman-festival-of-boundaries-1.3803276&quot;&gt;Terminalia and Terminus also sneak into Irish place names and traditional events&lt;/a&gt; (link to a great Irish Times article on the subject)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terminators around the world are encouraged to celebrate this momentous day. Wear white, sacrifice a lamb, let the spirit of pre-Republican Rome flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/0*P0qHv01fUcd8XSMU.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;modern festival&quot; /&gt;
Get out there, Terminators&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>TerminusDB community arrived in London</title>
        <description>
            
            <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4096/1*EzEM1bN4cljnckggA_gjzw.jpeg" alt="cover image"/>
            
            
            &lt;p&gt;We had our first meetup in London last Tuesday at the beautiful Microsoft Reactor located in the centre of the city! Members of the TerminusDB team from Dublin and Berlin came to visit the community. Of course, there were pizzas and lots of beers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We have lots of nice beer at Microsoft Reactor Meetup space, come have some. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/tUsgF5GZCw&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/tUsgF5GZCw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Dmytri Kleiner (@dmytri) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dmytri/status/1227295076218482688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 11, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got so much love for our swags! London Terminators participated and won our e-coffee mugs that made out of bamboo. I hope they will bring them in when buying their morning dose of coffee in their favourite coffee shops. Also, we gave out lots of our Cowduck stickers and T-shirts. Cowduck is winning the heart of Terminators!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Loving the logo and looking forward to learning more &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/TerminusDB?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#TerminusDB&lt;/a&gt; !!!! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/JWKlERYLuU&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/JWKlERYLuU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Ed Outhwaite (@allyrdatarb2us) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/allyrdatarb2us/status/1227307800419864578?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 11, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luke, our Commercial Lead, gave a warm welcome to all the Terminators. He told a story about the origin of Cowduck and announced a competition that you don’t wanna miss (£100 Amazon gift coupon, swags and speaking opportunities!) Make sure you enter before 17th March 2020 (St. Patrick’s Day!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;It is COMPETITION time! 🥳🥳🥳&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use UK Parliament Data with TerminusDB to do something interesting and win prizes! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Details:&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/SEnsncy4Jj&quot;&gt;https://t.co/SEnsncy4Jj&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; TerminusDB (@TerminusDB) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TerminusDB/status/1227592043486158850?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 12, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our BDFL (benevolent dictator for life) Gavin Mendel-Gleason gave a talk about the internals of TerminusDB. It covers a lot of the design that explains why TerminusDB can store data like git and do it in an efficient way. Our Terminators are very interested and asked a lot of questions. Slides can be found here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;und&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We ♥️ &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/London?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#London&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/6rnJYCW1CL&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/6rnJYCW1CL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; TerminusDB (@TerminusDB) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TerminusDB/status/1227311804512161794?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 11, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a short break, we continued with a short workshop in creating a knowledge graph with bike hire data. It was a great success as most of our Terminators has created a graph with no problems! Terminators are smart! In case you missed it or if you want to revisit the tutorial, we have a step by step guide here in &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/terminusdb/my-first-terminusdb-graph-visualisation-bike-share-data-39c59a1ab86a?source=friends_link&amp;amp;sk=2f877df5dcb2f00b9e4e85d5088f015e&quot;&gt;this blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Pretty detailed live workshop for &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TerminusDB?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@TerminusDB&lt;/a&gt; and get to meet all the core devs &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/JhwY3eDsJs&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/JhwY3eDsJs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Steven Lee (@kynrai) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kynrai/status/1227327544044773382?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 11, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

        <title>TerminusDB Discussions</title>
        <description>
            
            <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2040/1*MLXi8J5vwHQheBcEo5T-EA.png" alt="cover image"/>
            
            
            &lt;p&gt;One of the really nice things about TerminusDB is our weekly get together where one team member gives a short presentation on something. It doesn’t have to be work, it doesn’t have to be TerminusDB, it can be anything really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are a moderately distributed team and we have plenty of opportunity for detailed technical discussion (indexing strategy anyone?) so we thought that it’d be a good idea to start a less formal weekly exchange. One member of the team leads the discussion and the rest contribute with questions &amp;amp; comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the year and a bit since we started the tradition, we’ve had everything from the innards of JavaScript to Crypto Kitties to Theories of Developer Relations to Cloud Architecture to the Dialectics of Software Development (a personal favorite — I must post the slides).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/1602/1*AiOAyqAcjMq5qd8fBUdw2w.png&quot; alt=&quot;The right superstructure is important&quot; /&gt;
The right superstructure is important&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve also had nuclear power, the political economy of open source software, values vs virtues and Terry Davis (TempleOS is something else — I’d encourage all to check it out).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really whatever was of special interest to the person assigned that day. I looked back through the chat and realize that I have suggested ‘Practical Maoism for the Workplace’ twice and nobody has taken up my lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/1308/1*qa5C7ZG-4mvCH5KKJaUiLg.png&quot; alt=&quot;The system's features, such as its 640x480 resolution, 16-color display and single audio voice, were explicitly instructed to Terry Davis by God&quot; /&gt;
The system’s features, such as its 640x480 resolution, 16-color display and single audio voice, were explicitly instructed to Terry Davis by God&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tradition has grown to be an important part of every TerminusDB week. If we continue to grow the core group, I’m not sure how we’ll scale — 1 week in 30 might be a little infrequent. We can cross that bridge when we get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So anyway, we really value these discussions and thought the the broader Terminus Community might also enjoy. We’ve recorded the latest discussion, which took place yesterday, and uploaded it to our YouTube channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week we were led by our BDFL Gavin in a discussion of ‘Regular Expressions - Theory and Practice’. It covers a bunch of interesting aspects including Chomsky’s Hierarchy, Büchi automata, grammars and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/mbtpAyn0n0o&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I apologize for the sound quality issues — we’ll work on a setup that captures the various contributors in high fidelity. At least you can hear the main presentation. Only one instance of adult language — less than normal I’d say — so be warned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be a regular series, so watch this space.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Loading your local files in TerminusDB</title>
        <description>
            
            <img src="/assets/images/cowduck_banner.jpeg" alt="cover image"/>
            
            
            &lt;p&gt;We have got lot’s of feedback since we have posted our tutorial — &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/terminusdb/my-first-terminusdb-graph-visualisation-bike-share-data-39c59a1ab86a?source=friends_link&amp;amp;sk=2f877df5dcb2f00b9e4e85d5088f015e&quot;&gt;My First TerminusDB Graph Visualisation&lt;/a&gt;. One of the most common questions is how to load a local CSV in the hard drive into your TerminusDB running in a local docker container. So here is how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your container is running stop it with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;./terminus-container stop
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Extra tip: you may want to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;./terminus-container rm-config&lt;/code&gt; now before you mount the volume. This remove old settings to advoid version conflits that may comes in later if there’s a newer version of Docker image avaliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;set the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;TERMINUS_LOCAL&lt;/code&gt; environment variable to the path to the parent directory of your csv:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;export TERMINUS_LOCAL=/home/me/somewhere
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;for Windows users:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;export TERMINUS_LOCAL=c:/Users/you/somewhere
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Go to Docker Desktop Settings and make sure that the Drive (i.e. ‘C’) your file on is enabled in Shared Drives&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/2474/1*YYgIRufPKRw724nIuWRHzw.png&quot; alt=&quot;Windows setup&quot; /&gt;
Make sure the ‘C’ is clicked and ‘Apply’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then start your container again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;./terminus-container run
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;now, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;TERMINUS_LOCAL&lt;/code&gt; will be mounted as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/app/local_files&lt;/code&gt;
so, in your WOQL query, you can use:
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.file(/app/local_files/myfilename.csv)&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.remote()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope it helps with lot’s of you who want to load csv locally.

        <title>Design a Query Language Client for Pythonistas and Data Scientists</title>
        <description>
            
            <img src="/assets/images/cowduck_sitting_logo.png" alt="cover image"/>
            
            
            &lt;p&gt;Having an effective yet user-friendly query language is one of the most important aspects of successful database technology. Here at TerminusDB, we aim to provide a good experience to our users whose main language is Python. Enter WOQLpy — a Query Language Client for Pythonistas and Data Scientists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-woqlpy&quot;&gt;What is WOQLpy?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WOQLpy comes with the Terminus Python Client which you can install with pip:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip install terminus-client-python
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example usage:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;woqlclient.woqlClient&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;woql&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;woqlclient&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;WOQLQuery&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;server_url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;http://localhost:6363&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;root&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dbId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;pybike&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;client&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;woql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;WOQLClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;                       &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;connect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;server_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;createDatabase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dbId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Bicycle Graph&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;station&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;WOQLQuery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;doctype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Station&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Bike Station&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;                                                                             &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;journey&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;WOQLQuery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;doctype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Journey&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;                           &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;journey&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;journey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Journey&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;journey&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;journey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;start_station&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Station&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Start Station&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;journey&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;journey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;end_station&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Station&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;End Station&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;                           
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;schema&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;WOQLQuery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;when&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;woql_and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;station&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;journey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;                           
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;schema&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complete script can be found in GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you see, the python client can execute a query created with WOQLpy. It is because WOQLpy lets you build WOQL — the original query language in JSON-LD format with methods in WOQLQuery object and send it to TerminusDB through the Python client. Without WOQLpy, queries need to be written in JSON-LD, for example, the same query above will be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-json highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;when&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;true&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;and&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;challenges-in-design&quot;&gt;Challenges in design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s nice to have WOQLpy, but there are some challenges in adopting WOQL in Python. For example, you may notice that there is a method in the example called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;woql_and&lt;/code&gt;, in WOQL, there are operations that are the same as the Python keywords, to name a few: and, or, not, as, from. In this case, we added the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;woql_&lt;/code&gt; prefix to make it valid in Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another challenge is, as many of the methods we allow provide for more that one way of input, for example, with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.label&lt;/code&gt; we allow users to input just a string “Journey” or a dictionary {“@value”: “Journey”, “@language”: “en”}, we have to do lots of checking in handling different user inputs. But it is totally worth it as we believe it will give a better usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;make-it-better-for-data-scientist&quot;&gt;Make it better for Data Scientist&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are still at the beginning of our journey to make TerminusDB super useful for data scientists. One of the features that we have in mind to implement is to make our &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/terminusdb/my-first-terminusdb-graph-visualisation-bike-share-data-39c59a1ab86a?source=friends_link&amp;amp;sk=2f877df5dcb2f00b9e4e85d5088f015e&quot;&gt;cool graph visualization&lt;/a&gt; embedded in Jupyter notebook. Right now it is possible to be embedded to websites thanks to our Javascript client. We should be able to do that same to Jupyter notebook for Python client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, we think it would be nice to have a direct io with pandas data frame instead of passing it with csvs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TerminusDB is open-source, we would like to invite you to try it out and give us feedback and ideas. Please feel free to join the slack channel and chat with the team: &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/terminusdb-slack&quot;&gt;http://bit.ly/terminusdb-slack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>TerminusDB 1.1 — The Big Babushka</title>
        <description>
            
            <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2820/1*y6pmHcjylW-YGQFbtlXicw.png" alt="cover image"/>
            
            
            &lt;p&gt;Another very big day for us — our first iteration on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/terminusdb/terminus-server&quot;&gt;TerminusDB goes out into the wild&lt;/a&gt;. We are calling it the &lt;strong&gt;Big Babushka&lt;/strong&gt; release as it has some huge changes to the way we manage data and the operations we support — it could almost be a 2.0, but given that we are a relatively young DB, we want to save those release numbers for future exciting developments (I did see another DB on release 0.50.0 — I won’t name names, but come on folks, give us a 1.0!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;terminus-store&quot;&gt;Terminus-store&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major development is our new storage backend, terminus-store. With the introduction of the new store, TerminusDB takes a radical departure from traditional database architectures. Our approach has three parts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We have a graph database with strong schema to retain simplicity and generality&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The graph is implemented using succinct immutable data structures which enable more sparing use of main memory resources.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We adopt a delta encoding approach to updates (‘like git, but for data’) which provides the whole suite of revision control features: branch, merge, squash, rollback, blame, and time-travel facilitating CI/CD approaches on data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This final point is crucial — with TerminusDB we can now use advanced CI/CD workflows in data operations. The large impact of git on the software development world can now be envisioned in the world of data. This is made possible by synergies between an immutable layered approach and the succinct data structure approach that we’ve used for encoding. The DevOps revolution becomes the DataOps revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as with DevOps, DataOps means a focus on collaboration, automation and integration. There is a requirement to bridge what is today a chasm between huge reams of unstructured data on the one hand, and analysts looking for access to simple, clean, structured data on the other. DataOps is that bridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TerminusDB is a practical tool for enabling branch, merge, rollback, and the various automated and manual testing regimes which they facilitate on a transactional database management system while providing sophisticated query support&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/1194/1*ADSnYco_5vlMbLT7eiT2Rw.png&quot; alt=&quot;showing how TerminusDB transections&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new TerminusDB store is implemented in Rust. It is low level, memory safe, has no run time and is C compatible. We think Rust will be the language of the 2020s and we are delighted to be Rustaceans!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/terminusdb/terminus-server/blob/dev/docs/whitepaper/terminusdb.pdf&quot;&gt;TerminusDB Technical Paper&lt;/a&gt; that goes into this in more detail for those interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/1678/1*S9ho_dXwojark-UnLrRSeQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;White Paper&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;woql&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Web Object Query Language — or WOQL — has developed considerably since our first release:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Extended WOQL to greater functionality for string and arithmetic processing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Better date handling in WOQL&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improved type casting in WOQL&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improvements to query processing speed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growing maturity of WOQL provides a strong platform to import, clean and query complex data. WOQL remains the best graph query language available today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WOQL itself is specified as a JSON document format. All transmission of data uses the canonical JSON format, but this is generally annoying to write, hence WOQL.js is the preferred means by which human users can write queries manually. In developing WOQL we wanted to make querying graph data easy to learn, understand, and use, but also build on the power and functionality of other standard data access languages. As we can see from the TerminusDB tutorials, WOQL is a highly composable and flexible graph query language. Graphs are very generically applicable to a much wider range of data than table structured data. Ultimately, the flexibility of graphs with well specified schema, will show their value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;terminus--console&quot;&gt;Terminus — Console&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new Console significantly builds on the simple JavaScript client application that released with 1.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the query interface, you can now switch between WOQL.js and JSON. You can also add new queries to the original query — as inspired by the Jupyter Notebook functionality you know and love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/3474/1*uScpmhNCu0UwUR30Y_RGAA.png&quot; alt=&quot;TerminusDB console&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have run your query, we have a view interface to easily change the view on the output&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the console you now have the ability to toggle between table and graph view. On the query page, on the document page and on the schema page, you can see as a graph. This is super helpful when you are trying to see what’s in a complex schema, or trying to derive insight from a query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new Console gives user a quality interface for managing and querying TerminusDB. It ships with TerminusDB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;python-client&quot;&gt;Python Client&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the release of the TerminusDB python client, python users can query data and interact with TerminusDB through the API and WOQL.py. We will continue to work to make TerminusDB more accessible for the python community (firstly, by improving our documentation!). TerminusDB is the database for data people, and there are no people that are more data than Pythonistas!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What’s Next&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are working hard on our collaboration and DataOps features. They should be available by the end of February 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll be pushing out documentation as fast as we can. There is lots of new stuff available, including a couple of tutorials, but it is never enough!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember we are open source (GPLv3) now and forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(And for anybody wondering, that’s CowDuck, our new mascot)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Are you supporting the right politician?</title>
        <description>
            
            
            <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/7618/1*00M5JbvyMgh3MRz7uQf-kw.jpeg" alt="cover image"/>
            
            &lt;h2 id=&quot;terminusdb-graph-visualisation-of-dublin-council-voting-data&quot;&gt;TerminusDB graph visualisation of Dublin Council voting data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you ever check to see the actual voting record of your preferred politician before you vote? Or, do you just vote for them because of their party affiliation? Do you think your local representative speaks for you on the issues that you care about?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Politics can be complicated, my friend, but data never lies. In this tutorial, we will use TerminusDB to show you how to analyse the voting behavior of politicians. For demonstration purposes we’ll use a dataset describing the voting records of Councillors in Dublin City Council, the birthplace of TerminusDB, retrieved from &lt;a href=&quot;https://counciltracker.ie/&quot;&gt;https://counciltracker.ie/&lt;/a&gt;, the cleaned data used in the tutorial can be &lt;a href=&quot;https://terminusdb.com/t/data/council/weighted_similarity.csv&quot;&gt;downloaded here&lt;/a&gt;. (Thanks &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dublininquirer.com/&quot;&gt;Dublin Inquirer&lt;/a&gt; for the great work — have to keep the politicians on their toes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll use WOQL, the web object query language, a powerful and highly composable graph query language, throughout the tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(We’re assuming you already have TerminusDB installed, but if you haven’t go to our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/terminusdb/terminus-quickstart&quot;&gt;quick start installation guide&lt;/a&gt;. It’s very easy to get started.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;create-a-database-and-a-schema&quot;&gt;Create a Database and a Schema&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a Database in the +Create Database link on the left hand side of the terminus-console. You could call it &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dublin_council&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/3608/1*_40iXp2ntk6WD2ACNmm_nQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;create database&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once it is created, go to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Query&lt;/code&gt; link on the left, and enter the following query:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;when&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;doctype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Party&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Party&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Political Party&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;doctype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Representative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Representative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;An elected member of the Dublin Council&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;member_of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Party&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Member of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;cardinality&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;doctype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Similarity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Similarity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;similarity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;decimal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Similarity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;similar_to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Representative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Similar To&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;cardinality&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and click &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Submit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a quick check to make sure the schema is there. Click Schema in the left hand navigation bar and you should have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/2758/1*9PE_cpKZDIMAX9Fz7OPjbw.png&quot; alt=&quot;classes in a schema&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you click the graph view button (circled in red), you should see:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/2772/1*-e_HmFelPXAW5FHn9QRJgg.png&quot; alt=&quot;graph of classes in schema&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the query above, we created 3 &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;doctype&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Party&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Representative&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Similarity&lt;/code&gt;. Regarding the property, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Representative&lt;/code&gt; is the member of 1 &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Party&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Similarity&lt;/code&gt; will consist of a decimal number and linking up 2 &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Representative&lt;/code&gt;. We created the schema using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;when()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;load-in-the-political-voting-data&quot;&gt;Load in the Political Voting Data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, we need &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;csv&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;wrangles&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;inserts&lt;/code&gt; to load in the data. We’re going to use the query to import the data, clean it and match it. As you might have seen in other TerminusDB tutorials, WOQL is a highly composable language, you can combine queries arbitrarily using logical ANDs and ORs.

            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;similar_to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Rep_B_ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;similarity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Similarity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;inputs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;csv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;wrangles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;when&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;inputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;inserts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and click &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Submit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the csv we load in all the relevant columns of the csv and link them with a variable identified with v: using as()&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the wrangles we have to do data wrangling operations, idgen() for creating id for fields and typecast() to cast the Distance column in to a decimal objects as Similarity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our inputs are now ready (created by csv and wrangles)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the inserts, we actually slot the objects in, the variables created in the wrangles will be insert() with an id. We can also add label(), descriptions() and property()&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Load the data using another when()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the data in TerminusDB, you can now click on the documents and explore. It should look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/3502/1*sZD377lF0PbSoZ-P3ttQJw.png&quot; alt=&quot;documents of the database&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can then click on a party to explore further — click on the Green Party for example and you can see their members:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/2782/1*J5uLs4-mVvuiOA7xtl6QFw.png&quot; alt=&quot;members of Green party&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then click on Patrick Costello and you get his similarity scoring with the other members of the council:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/2812/1*86Xpjqr4HTCo4ViW36aT5g.png&quot; alt=&quot;similarity of Patrick Costello&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can quickly see the similarities across the Councillors. Substituting products for people, it’s easy to see how a similar process could build a recommendation engine for e-commerce or another service. We’ll put those additional steps in the next TerminusDB tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click on one of the others at random and you get this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/2806/1*UaRyfHoX9i9S4A-0xRnE0A.png&quot; alt=&quot;similarity between Patrick Costello and Rebecca Moynihan&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is a high similarity score (0.854) for Councillors from different parties (Rebecca Moynihan is in the Labour Party).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;query-and-visualisation&quot;&gt;Query and Visualisation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now with the schema and data in place, we can build some queries and visualise the outputs as a graph. First we have to create a query (of course):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;limit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;triple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Subject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;similar_to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;triple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Subject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;similar_to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Value2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;triple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Subject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;similarity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Similarity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;triple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;member_of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Party&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;triple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Value2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;member_of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Party2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;eq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Value2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;opt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;triple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Lab1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;eval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;divide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;exp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Similarity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Distance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and click &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Submit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;WOQL.limiti(1000).and&lt;/code&gt; to limit the result set and shorten the query time (we’ll show the full scaled up results later)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This query only uses &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;triple()&lt;/code&gt; not &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;quad()&lt;/code&gt; we are only extracting data from a single database (including &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;quad()&lt;/code&gt; allows you to specify which databases you want to extract data from)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;opt()&lt;/code&gt; to ignore the missing objects (instead of returning an error)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;eval()&lt;/code&gt; to execute arithmetic calculation (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;divide()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;exp()&lt;/code&gt;) and store it to variable &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Distance&lt;/code&gt;, this variable is calculated from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Similarty&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will now have results in a tabular form below the query:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/2734/1*0HeHCKMDGalsg0lnPaBB-w.png&quot; alt=&quot;query result in a table&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hard to make sense out of the result! But at least we see we have results from our query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make a graph visualisation, click on the graph button (the right most of the 3 at the top right of the table):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/1988/1*xF6c0AhuC7J6OwNDwbAEvQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;a messy graph&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow! What is this madness! As we have show everything from the query: every object, every property, label, description… things are a little too busy to make visual sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to customize the view of the graph. Click on the left most button of the 3 at the top right, you will see an extra input field for the view:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/3196/1*lN10ba9auHPi-0VAS7nlzg.png&quot; alt=&quot;view pane&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replace everything with our customised view script:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;view&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;View&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;graph&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Update view&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We hidden() some node()&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Customize the edge() to have the distance() equal to the variable Distance and have a equal weight() of 0.04. It will also show the value of Distance when mouse on&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Replace the icon() with the label() of Lab, which is the name of the politicians.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;charge() and collisionRadius() makes the nodes have a natual seperation with each other (avoid clustering) for easier viewing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💥now we have a much nicer graph:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/1740/1*CAZV-VB2EKsmE1GMfBwigw.png&quot; alt=&quot;nicer graph&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait, are we missing something? Oh, the party of the politicians, let’s colour code the politicians to their party so we can make easy sense of the graph. Let’s edit the view again with this script:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;view&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;View&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;graph&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;view&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Value2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Party2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;doc:PartyWorkers'%20Party&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;225&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;225&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;225&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the script is a bit long, but it is not complicated. For example, if the politician has &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Party&lt;/code&gt; equal to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PartyGreen Party&lt;/code&gt; (%20 for white space), colour the node [225, 225, 125] which is light green (matching the colour code from the source website):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/2364/1*DUyqby2Oq7MrZjkPgnlrXw.png&quot; alt=&quot;colour code of different parties from counciltracker.ie&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same also apply to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Lab2&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Party2&lt;/code&gt; (and they are just the parallel image of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Lab&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Party&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s try to see the whole picture by removing the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;limit(1000&lt;/code&gt;) from our query and click &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;submit&lt;/code&gt;. (Warning: you need memory for handling the graphics and it might take a few seconds to load).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/1710/1*1tFXtXdoeOAMMxAYvVGt9A.png&quot; alt=&quot;completed graph&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some really interesting conclusions we can quickly draw from viewing the data in this way. Specifically, the data allows us to draw the following conclusions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Political parties do tend to vote in a reasonably homogeneous fashion (the distribution is not random, or anything close to it)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sinn Fein enjoy the strongest disciplinary record in terms of council votes, with all Councillors clustered closely together&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fine Gael and Fianna Fail are heavily inter-mingled, to the extent that they could almost be considered a single party&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The same could be said for the Green Party and Labour Party, who present as a single block in this analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These results are interesting in and of themselves. But in addition, the visualisation of data in this way enables us to see a continuum across the political spectrum, and accurately place parties on that spectrum based on real data rather than perception or prejudice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly this data shows clearly the politics of any given independent just by looking which parties they are situated with. A few independents seem to occupy an equivalent status to Sinn Féin or Fianna Fáil-Fine Gael. A few hover around the Solidarity-People-Before Profit-Workers’ Party nexus. However, the voting positions of the Greens and Labour are not apparently so popular with the unaffiliated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it is your turn. Change the parameters in the view script to play around and mix things up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more thing to do is to analyse different dataset. Here is some open data from the US Congress that you can play around, and a quick WOQL query to build the schema:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;when&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;doctype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Party&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Party&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to use any open data to do the same analysis — we’d love to see the results. In fact, TerminusDB is running a competition on UK political data. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TerminusDB/status/1214829778387296256&quot;&gt;Check it out over on twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My First TerminusDB Graph Visualisation — Bike Share Data</title>
        <description>
            
            
            <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/10944/1*wHpEF7tcwMY0OqIC33mxKA.jpeg" alt="cover image"/>
            
            &lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, we will start using TerminusDB and its query client — WOQL.js — to quickly build a database and a schema; import and organise data; create a visualisation; and plug it in to your website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re assuming you already have TerminusDB installed, but if you haven’t go to our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/terminusdb/terminus-quickstart&quot;&gt;quick start installation guide&lt;/a&gt;. It’s very easy to get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, we are going to import data from CSVs about bike journeys between stations in Washington D.C., USA, build a knowledge graph from the data, analyse and visualise it. The data is taken from Capital Bike Share (available here — thanks folks!) and the CSV data used this tutorial is available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://terminusdb.com/t/data/bike_tutorial.csv&quot;&gt;https://terminusdb.com/t/data/bike_tutorial.csv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lets-create-a-database&quot;&gt;Let’s Create a Database&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing we need to do is to create a database for our graph. Open up the Terminus DB console ( default: http://localhost:6363/console ). Click on &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Create Database&lt;/code&gt; to start with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can specify an id for the database, to make it memorable, let’s make it &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1stdb&lt;/code&gt; (note that Terminus IDs are URLs and they cannot have spaces!). As a title, enter the name you want to give your Database, something meaningful like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;My First Database&lt;/code&gt;. Then you can add a short description to your database, like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It is my first database using TerminusDB&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/2232/1*_05f3gD0v45a-Xncpv1SUQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;Create Database&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Create&lt;/code&gt; button at the bottom, and you should see the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Successfully Created Database&lt;/code&gt; 1stDB in green at the top. Something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/2096/1*iDole0nJP9PpxQHCkzaUBw.png&quot; alt=&quot;Successfully created Database&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we have a database, let’s have a look at the data we want to import. Click on the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Query&lt;/code&gt; link in the left hand menu and you should see a query page that looks like the screen below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;lets-preview-the-data&quot;&gt;Let’s Preview the Data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/3490/1*ayRgYyCY2-yUOTrhJZxURA.png&quot; alt=&quot;TerminusDB Query Page&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TerminusDB has a powerful query language called WOQL (Web Object Query Language) which supports Javascript and Python as well as pure JSON. In this case we will use WOQL.js as we can input it directly into the console. One of the nice things about WOQL is that we can query directly from remote CSV files anywhere on the web. Copy the following query into the console and click &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Submit&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Start station&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Start_Station&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;End station&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:End_Station&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Start date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Start_Time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;End date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:End_Time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Duration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Duration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Start station number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Start_ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;End station number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:End_ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Bike number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Bike&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Member type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Member_Type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;remote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;https://terminusdb.com/t/data/bike_tutorial.csv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should see a result that looks like the screen below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/4910/1*ylh1o-If4F5AMQTSZq1bQQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;CSV Preview Result Screen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This query reads data directly from the CSV — &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;remote&lt;/code&gt; specifies the location of the CSV and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; specifies how the columns in the CSV should be loaded into WOQL variables. The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; takes 2 lists as parameters: the 1st is the title of the column in the CSV, while the 2nd is the name of a variable that we can use to refer to the data in that column in other parts of the query. In technical terms we are binding the variables, for example &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;v:Start_Station&lt;/code&gt; is bound to the data in the column with the header “Start Station” (WOQL variables always start with v: and can’t contain spaces).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This query allows us to preview the data without importing it, but if we want to really analyse, we need to import it into our TerminusDB database. The first step is to create a schema to govern the structure of the data that we will store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lets-create-a-schema&quot;&gt;Let’s Create a Schema&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have had a look at the data, we have a good idea of what we want in our graph and we can build a schema for our database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The schema allows you to organise data into meaningful objects, and it ensures data integrity — nothing goes into your database that is not in the schema. This is a TerminusDB super power — and ensures you derive long term value from your data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TerminusDB Console provides a schema editor using WOQL.js. Remaining on the query page, copy this WOQL.js query into the text box (remember to delete the previous query before entering this one):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;when&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;         
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;doctype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Station&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;             
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Bike Station&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;             
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;A station where bicycles are deposited&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;         
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;doctype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Bicycle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;             
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Bicycle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;         
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;doctype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Journey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;             
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Journey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Time Ended&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;journey_bicycle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Bicycle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Bicycle Used&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and click &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Submit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s stop to review this schema-building WOQL query:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The when will perform the operation for every time its first argument istrue. In this case, exactly once.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We perform all operations within the and.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here’s the operations we have performed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We created three different document types (given by the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;doctype&lt;/code&gt; function): &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Station&lt;/code&gt; , &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Journey&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Bicycle&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We added &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;label&lt;/code&gt; (names) or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;description&lt;/code&gt; (short descriptions) to them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We created properties for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Journey&lt;/code&gt;, we do that by using the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;property&lt;/code&gt; function after &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Journey&lt;/code&gt; with the first argument as the name of the property and the second argument as the type (or range) of the property.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For each property, you have to provide an id and the type of that property in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;property&lt;/code&gt;, as with class you can add a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;label&lt;/code&gt; to it as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check that you have successfully created the schema by clicking the Schema button on the left. You should now be able to see the classes and properties in table format and get a graph representation by clicking the ‘graph’ button (circled in red):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lets-load-in-the-data&quot;&gt;Let’s Load in the Data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s get to the good part. We have our schema, which defines the shape of the data and ensures data integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll now load the data from the CSV. We’re going to progressively extend the query to import the data, cleaning it and matching it as we go. WOQL is a highly composable language, you can combine queries arbitrarily using logical ANDs and ORs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s build the next query in steps and only hit &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Submit&lt;/code&gt; at the end of the query (full query is available at the bottom of the section)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go back to the Query page, and copy in the following query:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;//Read data from CSV&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;csv&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Start station&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Start_Station&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;End station&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:End_Station&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;//Combine with logical and&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;csv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;wrangles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/4478/1*MXJohHDXNIN6zuoBVjacnQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;Result of import / clean data query&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll explain each of the steps in this query in turn. As a first step, we saved the part of the query that imports the data from CSV in a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; variable named &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;csv&lt;/code&gt;. Then we create a list of WOQL operators and save it in another constvariable called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;wrangles&lt;/code&gt;, we combine the two parts of the query with a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;WOQL.and&lt;/code&gt; operator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;wrangles&lt;/code&gt; clause uses 3 WOQL functions to transform the data into the correct form for input. In each case, the function creates a new variable as output — the last argument in each case. The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;idgen&lt;/code&gt; function generates IDs for our three document types &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Journey&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Station&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Bicycle&lt;/code&gt;. The first argument is the prefix that will be used, the second is a list of variables which combine to give a unique identity for the id. For example, in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Journey&lt;/code&gt; we use 3 fields in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;csv&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Start_ID&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Start_Time&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Bike&lt;/code&gt;) to generate a unique id &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Journey_ID&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides generating IDs, we also create new fields with new data types, for example, we use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;typecast&lt;/code&gt; to cast &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Duration&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;integer&lt;/code&gt; and store it as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Duration_Cast&lt;/code&gt;. We can also use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;concat&lt;/code&gt; to contract new text formatted with variables in the fields — for example, to create &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Journey_Label&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll insert them in the graph by adding &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;triples&lt;/code&gt;! Triples are the atomic data entity in the RDF data model. We add the following to the query:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;inputs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;csv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;wrangles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;inserts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;insert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Journey_ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Journey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;end_time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:ET_Cast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:SS_Label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;insert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:End_Station_URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Station&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:ES_Label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;insert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Bike_URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Bicycle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Bike_Label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the clause that actually inserts the data into the structure that we defined on our schema.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;insert&lt;/code&gt; function inserts a new node into the database with the id &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Journey_ID&lt;/code&gt; and type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Journey&lt;/code&gt; we add properties like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;start_time&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;end_time&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;duration&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;start_station&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;end_station&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;label&lt;/code&gt; and put the variables produced above in their correct spots.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Start_Station_URL&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;End_Station_URL&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Bike_URL&lt;/code&gt;, we assign a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;label&lt;/code&gt; for each of them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we have to put all of the above together and create the query that reads the data from the csv, do the data wrangling and add them in the graph as triples. We add this to complete the query:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;when&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;inputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;inserts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and click &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;submit&lt;/code&gt;. Remember, this is getting the data in to our graph so you won’t have a query output just yet. It should look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/2688/1*fKSEaLdiwPdpNH_QOOiStw.png&quot; alt=&quot;query result&quot; /&gt;
We are working to make it prettier!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or this if you have the view pane open:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/2710/1*x-Pj1FTVVeVLqll7e3EGuw.png&quot; alt=&quot;open view pane&quot; /&gt;
The little x closes the view pane and the button opens it (both circled in red)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full query in all it’s glory and in easy to copy format:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;csv&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Start station&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Start_Station&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:ES_Label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;insert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Bike_URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Bicycle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Bike_Label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;//Combine inputs and inserts with when clause&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;when&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;inputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;inserts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and click &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;submit&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we have the data in our graph❗️ And we can start querying ( 💪🏼).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have more than one CSV that you want to load in programmatically, you can so easily with a script and our API. You can find both Javascript and Python scripts that cover and extend this tutorial at: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/terminusdb/terminus-tutorials/blob/master/bike-tutorial/javascript/index.html&quot;&gt;https://github.com/terminusdb/terminus-tutorials/tree/master/bike-tutorial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lets-query-the-data-and-visualise-it&quot;&gt;Let’s Query The Data and Visualise It&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the query page — again input into the WOQL.js query builder:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Start_Label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:End&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:End_Label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;

	&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;triple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Journey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;start_station&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;

	&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;triple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Journey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;end_station&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:End&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;opt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;triple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:End&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:End_Label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;triple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Journey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;journey_bicycle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Bike&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;click &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Submit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should see the query returning a table:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/2716/1*gv6sXsUvEjXteY0wZqgYfA.png&quot; alt=&quot;query returns a table&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we used &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;select&lt;/code&gt; to filter out the variables (those starting with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;v:&lt;/code&gt;) that appear in our output. Then we used &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; to link all the conditions we want to include, as you can see there are lot’s of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;triples&lt;/code&gt; to be conditioned. The ones with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;opt()&lt;/code&gt; means that they are optional — it will be ignored if that data is missing (instead of returning an error — very handy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The query can be translated as below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;select all the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Journeys&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and all the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;start_stations&lt;/code&gt; of all the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Journeys&lt;/code&gt; (let’s call them &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Start&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and, if any, all the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;labels&lt;/code&gt; of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;start_stations&lt;/code&gt; (let’s call them &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Start_Label&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and all the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;end_stations&lt;/code&gt; of all the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Journeys&lt;/code&gt; (let’s call them &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;End&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and, if any, all the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;labels&lt;/code&gt; of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;end_stations&lt;/code&gt; (let’s call them &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;End_Label&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and all the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;journey_bicycles&lt;/code&gt; of all the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Journeys&lt;/code&gt; (let’s call them &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Bike&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we now have a query that gives us a result, but it doesn’t mean much in a table — we can click the graph button and that gives us a basic graph:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/2742/1*uKREL4NhiB3MdDAQQx9Iog.png&quot; alt=&quot;result as graph&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to change the view and turn the query output into a graph visualisation that give us insights about bike journeys in Washington D.C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So lets click on the view button beside the graph (circled in red):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/2742/1*T2kI7TkDtmjsbQLjKXarqw.png&quot; alt=&quot;click on the view button&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should get this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/2730/1*1xr6zU_ezS5dpB5D2Pwk3w.png&quot; alt=&quot;start editing the view script&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the view text box (the query builder is still visible above) input the following (remembering to delete the text already in the box):&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v:Start_Label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;collisionRadius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;view&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;edge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;End&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And 💥 we have 🚲s: — a graphical model of all the journeys in the dataset between bike station. OK — it’s bike journey data between Washington D.C. stations, so not entirely relevant to all users, but you have completed the basics of TerminusDB and WOQL. You can now start to introduce more complex, more relevant data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/1640/1*cbF3mvAVCJAOS09F-FHMCw.png&quot; alt=&quot;graph showing all bike journeys&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what did we do here? First we use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;hidden(true)&lt;/code&gt; to hide some nodes — too many nodes complicate the graph with information we don’t need to see right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Updating &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;color&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;unicode&lt;/code&gt; changed the colours and inserted icons size set the icon &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;size&lt;/code&gt;, making the nodes a little bigger so they pop, and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;charge&lt;/code&gt; pushes the nodes away from each other so the view isn’t too cluttered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; in the graph so when you hover over the node you get the label — in this case the names of bike stations in Washington D.C. We use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;collisionRadius&lt;/code&gt; to determine the radius of the node in terms of collisions. Finally, we use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;view.edge&lt;/code&gt; to create lines between nodes setting what the end points are and set the weight to determine how dark the edges are — we don’t want the edges to dominate the view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lets-put-it-in-my-website&quot;&gt;Let’s Put it in My Website&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To finish off the tutorial, let’s take the data and put it in our website. You can use the files from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/terminusdb/terminus-tutorials/blob/master/bike-tutorial/javascript/bike-tutorial.js&quot;&gt;https://github.com/terminusdb/terminus-tutorials/blob/master/bike-tutorial/javascript/bike-tutorial.js&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/terminusdb/terminus-tutorials/blob/master/bike-tutorial/javascript/bike-tutorial.html&quot;&gt;https://github.com/terminusdb/terminus-tutorials/blob/master/bike-tutorial/javascript/bike-tutorial.html&lt;/a&gt; as examples. The basic idea is simple — you create a HTML page and include the TerminusDB libraries and dependencies in the header&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;https://terminusdb.github.io/terminus-dashboard/dist/terminus-dashboard.min.js&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;                           &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;https://d3js.org/d3.v5.min.js&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;                           &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.4.min.js&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;                           &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;rel=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;stylesheet&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.11.2/css/all.css&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, finally, we can use the library to load the query and view above and inject it into the DOM of our HTML page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;showView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;TerminusClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;View&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;TerminusClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;View&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;woql&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WOQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;S_Lab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;End&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;E_Lab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;res&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;tv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getResult&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;woql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;view&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;‘&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getAsDOM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can experiment with the query to find different things in the data, and the view to show it in different ways — for example, how would you find the routes covered by a specific bike?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well done — you are now a level 1 Terminator!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Join the Data-Centric Revolution (we can help!)</title>
        <description>
            
            <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2514/0*BqfeLvqCEA1CeDZN.png" alt="cover image"/>
            
            
            &lt;p&gt;If you have had the &lt;strong&gt;pleasure&lt;/strong&gt; of attending a TerminusDB presentation, you might have heard something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Unified, well-designed &amp;amp; refined data will be the jet fuel of future business’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘The value of AI will not be realized unless we feed enough relationship-rich data to machines’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that the next generation of world-changing ideas will be powered by graphs. Graph databases, like TerminusDB, can do everything a relational database can do and then some. RDBMS are stable and feature rich with four decades of development under the belt; however, over time, DBMS will continue to drift towards graph. There will, of course, always be legacy systems hanging around doing useful stuff. We bump into plenty of pre-relational technology out here (especially MUMPS in the healthcare sector) and there are good reasons not to change things that work — ‘database migration’ sends shivers down the spines of even battle-hardened DBAs. In the years to come, new and innovative projects will be implemented on graph DBs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/2514/0*BqfeLvqCEA1CeDZN.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ranking from DB-Engines&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time to shift to graph is very much now. There is an explosion of the number of databases, companies and projects using graph and we see legacy systems trying to squeeze graph models into places they don’t belong (we see you Datastax and MySQL). Native graph technology is now sufficiently mature to deliver value; hardware has come on-stream (as TerminusDB is an in-memory DB, big machines with lots of main memory are important for truly massive graphs); and organisations now understand the value in processing large amounts of data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are database and data-ops people. In order to bring TerminusDB to life, we have poured years of high-intensity effort into building the database. Considerable innovation — both theoretical and practical — was required to get to this point. So we know how hard starting a project, an NGO, a company or anything else can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is that we know about databases, but aren’t really so expert on other areas . Everywhere we look we see how data can be effectively applied to make the world better — we’re just not sure who will take the necessary steps. There is valuable, needle-moving data all around and it needs to be collected and queried effectively to make gains versus current standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is an area of human endeavor that is rich in data that is not being captured at present, there is a ripe opportunity to better understand. We are very aware of the possibilities in the area of research data — TerminusDB is the database behind ‘Seshat: the Global History Databank’, which seeks to systematically collect what is currently known about the social and political organization of human societies and how civilizations have evolved over time. When The Guardian recently ran a long piece about the project, some humanities scholars were vocally opposed to the very suggestion that data at scale could help us to understand the cycles of human history. We don’t agree. We think that there is a lot to learn — even about complex human systems — from organizing and querying large bodies of data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/1636/1*5OyhpZkTAAGERGV8I5qcvw.png&quot; alt=&quot;TerminusDB Contributor in the Mix&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about the movements of shipping containers, the efficiency of wind farms, the items in the supermarket or the output of salespeople. Where there is high volume, high activity data, there are serious questions to ask. If you can properly collect, store and query that data, you can try to recommend a next best action. The value of this recommendation will compound over time. With enough data in a big enough graph, you’ll start to see network effects and understand your world at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two industrial packaging plants next to each other. One has recorded data as a graph over many years and can query to see connections. The other fixes things when they break. The smart plant can start to predict with ever greater accuracy when things will stop working. Zero downtime is a massive and compounding advantage. One of these businesses will perform better over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linked knowledge allows you to train machines in best way possible. In future, instead of pulling data to generate reports, you can push data in packaged insights to inform the next step. This cybernetic approach to knowledge work can remove a lot of drudgery by minimizing choice and maximizing focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graph is the coming data model. The world will change, but some people haven’t seen it yet, so there is an opportunity. Unfortunately if you miss the data boat — it is difficult to catch up. The AI arms race is a zero sum game — those that use the data will win. We really, really want that to be the good guys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see a world full of opportunity, but can’t grasp it all. We call on startups, researchers, NGOs, government workers, factory operatives, hipsters, dreamers… anybody who thinks they can use data effectively to make the world a better place. TerminusDB is open source — released under the GPL v3 license — so there is no cost in using the database. We can offer you guidance, advice and encouragement. We believe that TerminusDB can offer value in a whole bunch of areas, and we want to help you realize that value. Join the data-centric revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Storing data like git — TerminusDB</title>
        <description>
            
            
            <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/8000/1*23WsqANJv5IS4ar-LGU2sw.jpeg" alt="cover image"/>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Last week I have been to a meetup where a team of software developers from Dublin talks about their newest invention — &lt;a href=&quot;https://terminusdb.com/&quot;&gt;TerminusDB&lt;/a&gt;, a graph database that stores data like git. My reaction was like, what? Imagine all the cool things you can do with git: time travel, branching and forking etc, you can do them with your data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s more, TerminusDB is a graph database, meaning all data are stored in nodes and edges, makes it easy to extract relations between your data without all the hideous joins in relational SQL database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, let’s talk about the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is a graph&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How git works&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How TerminusDB works&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-a-graph&quot;&gt;What is a graph?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In mathematics, a graph is a structure amounting to a set of objects in which some pairs of the objects are in some sense “related”. The objects correspond to mathematical abstractions called nodes and each of the related pairs of vertices is called an edge [&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common type of graphs is directed graphs and undirected graphs. The difference is, the edges of a directed graph have direction from a node to another but the edges of an undirected graph do not — it just linked two nodes together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/848/0*N7sgzupLg_9yXq_n.gif&quot; alt=&quot;example of graphs&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of our data can be stored in a graph, and the usage of graph databases are more than what you think: knowledge graph in Google and NASA, recommendation engines, fraud detection in financial services, machine learning using graphs in deep learning and AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/0*iOO7eoc9T2h1wt2u.png&quot; alt=&quot;recommendation via knowledge graph&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-git-works&quot;&gt;How git works&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who have not used git/ not familiar with git, let’s quickly recap how git works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/2026/0*R9RZrgyWQFMfSNae.png&quot; alt=&quot;explaining how git works&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you make changes in the repo, you will have to add your changes in the staging area, then you commit it. Git will store the new content and keep different commit as a series of events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/1600/0*pooMsU1ggBkhzBjK.png&quot; alt=&quot;get commit tree&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fun fact here, counter-intuitively, git does not store diff. Instead, it makes files into blobs and stores repo as a tree of pointers pointing to the blobs. It also stores the commits in sequences so it stores the history of the repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-terminusdb-works&quot;&gt;How TerminusDB works&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we see how similar TerminusDB is storing data in a chain of commits, layers in this case, just like git. However, it stores the diff instead (can see it having advantage in having a huge amount of data). For each layer, data, as a triplet consists of the edge and the nodes that it links, is stored either on the +ve plane or -ve plane (except the initial layer as everything was created).+ve means new data is added and -ve means that data is deleted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/1920/1*5Tww22yWeosH4T8UdwXq8w.gif&quot; alt=&quot;how TerminusDB works&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you make a query, you search from the most recent layer (the HEAD layer) back, if it is found in the +ve plane, it exists in the database; if it is found in the -ve plane, it existed at some point in time but was deleted so it can be concluded that does not exist anymore in the database. If it is not found on either, it goes one commit back and does the same thing until hitting the initial layer which finding the data or not can conclude whether it exists in the database or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/1920/1*sRDGALZFqc19jRhtyHl0Bw.gif&quot; alt=&quot;how TerminudDB stores data&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making changes to the data in the database is like making a new commit in git. Internally, a layer builder would build the +ve and -ve plane (except the initial layer of cause) and then commit it to the series of layers, moving the HEAD forward. This makes time travel as simple as moving the HEAD just like git. Also, imagine you can make a new branch and create more layers and merge it back to the master branch.
There’s so much potential in this genius design. I am already thinking about how this can give lot’s of advantage in processing data. I have talked to the team and they are super nice. As the product is quite new, they are happy to answer questions or hear feedback from you. Here are their contact details:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Graph Fundamentals — Part 3: Graph Schema Languages</title>
        <description>
            
            
            <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1080/0*FeAlvSzhtGFnp3sX.jpg" alt="cover image"/>
            
            &lt;p&gt;This is the third part of a four part series of a warts-and-all descriptions of graph database technologies —the first two covered the two fundamental flavors: &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/09/20/graph-fundamentals-part-1-rdf/&quot;&gt;RDF&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/09/25/graph-fundamentals-part-2-labelled-property-graphs/&quot;&gt;Labelled Property Graphs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third part of this series will cover the features and attempts to support the definition of schemata — rules defining the shape of the graph. Almost all of this work has been confined to the world of RDF — property graphs, by contrast, with their pragmatic focus on simplicity, took the approach of delegating the schema to code rather than imposing it in the data layer, only supporting primitive, low-level constraints on the basic node-edge structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, a somewhat bewildering series of standards and extensions have been built on top of RDF, mostly standardized by the W3C standards committee. This is where things get both really brilliant and ridiculously absurd. Shortly after publishing the RDF standard, the focus of researchers and standards bodies moved onto the problem of defining a schema to constrain and structure RDF graphs. This led to the publication of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/RDFS&quot;&gt;RDFS — the RDF Schema language&lt;/a&gt; in 2001. RDFS provided a variety of mechanisms for defining meta-data about graphs — most significantly, a concept of a class (rdfs:Class), a subclass (rdfs:subClassOf) and a mechanism for defining the types of the nodes on each end of a triple (rdfs:domain and rdfs:range).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These were important and much needed concepts — class hierarchies and typed properties are by far the most useful and important mechanisms for defining the structure of a graph — they are the cake, everything else is icing. They allow us to specify, for example, that an edge called “married_to” should join a person node with another person node and not, a giraffe, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, although the standard included all the most important concepts, once again, their definitions turned out to be completely wrong — their specified semantics didn’t actually allow them to be used to define typed properties and the things that they did allow people to specify turned out to be things that nobody wanted to specify. They simply died out, but not before causing a great deal of frustration and pain among those who tried to use them, under the assumption that the standards body wouldn’t produce something that just didn’t work. The only predicates that they defined that were ever really used as defined were the simplest ones rdfs:label and rdfs:comment, because they were both useful and were so simple and obvious that it was not possible to screw up their definitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, a couple of years after RDFS was released, the W3C released another language for describing RDF graphs, but this one was entirely a different proposition — while the earlier efforts had been driven by web-engineers, this time some of the world’s foremost formal logicians were the driving force - people such as Ian Horrocks and Peter Patel-Schneider. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/OWL/&quot;&gt;OWL — the Web Ontology Language&lt;/a&gt; — was the outcome and it went far, far beyond its predecessors in terms of formal correctness and expressiveness. Not only did it include the fundamentals — class hierarchies and typed properties, but it supported set-theoretic operations — intersection, unions, disjoint classes — with a firm basis in first order logic — not enough to describe everything you might want to describe about a graph, but many times more than anything else that has existed before or since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/1080/0*FeAlvSzhtGFnp3sX.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;An OWL&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trouble was, however, that along with the beautiful elegant logic, the academics brought their impracticality with them and they brought it into the standards committee sausage factory — the language was effectively defined by a standardisation body — the worst possible example of design by committee. The logicians involved have compiled some reasonably scathingly amusing descriptions of the process and their personal anecdotes are often hilarious — where political arguments about removing the “OR” operator as a means of simplifying the language were debated by people who clearly did not understand what they were arguing about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, from a language design point of view, the results were horrific. For example, while recognizing that &lt;em&gt;rdfs:domain&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;rdfs:range&lt;/em&gt; had been mis-defined, the committee decided to retain both predicates intact in OWL but to change their definitions — in order to appease vendors who had already produced RDFS implementations. This meant that, rather than doing the sensible thing and defining new &lt;em&gt;owl:subClassOf owl:domain owl:range&lt;/em&gt; predicates, the OWL language makes everybody include the rdfs namespace (and it’s ridiculously terrible and impossible to remember URL), in every Owl document so that they can use &lt;em&gt;rdfs:subClassOf&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;rdfs:domain&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;rdfs:range&lt;/em&gt; even though these predicates have completely different definitions within OWL — I’m still amazed that this one wasn’t laughed out the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A variety of other measures were included to appease existing vendors — various subsets of the language organized along misconceived classes of computational complexity which went on to confuse students eternally, because they made no sense in terms of mathematical computational complexity. None of this was made at all clear, of course, it was presented as a sensible and logical structure and still, to this day, almost nobody realizes just how ridiculous these decisions were — these are complex documents handed down by the gods and any incomprehension is due to the reader not getting it. Even though the language had a nice terse representation — the Manchester syntax — this was immediately sidelined in favor of an arcane, awkward and verbose RDF representation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, while the design by standards committee sausage factory produced a language design that was about as terrible as anybody could have managed if they were trying, these were mainly just syntactic issues which could be overlooked. What really killed OWL was the impracticality and idealism of the academics. They wanted a language that was capable of usefully describing an ‘open world’ — situations where any particular reasoning agent did not have a complete view of the facts — the idea being that such a regime was necessary for talking about the great new inter-linked world wide web, where information might be scattered to the four corners, and just because any individual agent did not know about a fact, it could not be assumed that it was not out there somewhere in the vast expanse of the digital world wide web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open world reasoning such as this is a very interesting and commendable — and sometimes highly useful — field. However, if I have a RDF graph of my own and I want to control and reason about its contents and structure in isolation from whatever else is out there, this is a decidedly closed world problem. It turns out that it is essentially impossible to do this through open world reasoning. If my database refers to a record that does not exist in my database (i.e a breach of referential integrity) then it does not matter whatever else exists in the world, that reference is wrong and I want to know about it. I most especially do not want my reasoning engine to decide that this record could exist somewhere else in the world — if it is not in my database it does not exist and I know this. If I cannot manage my own database and make sure that it is not full of errors, then it does not matter what else exists in the world because my house is built on a pile of mud. I can’t even control what’s in my own bloody database that I control entirely, who am I kidding that I can start reasoning about the universe beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s worse, there is absolutely no good reason not to include support for a closed world interpretation in OWL — you don’t even have to change a single piece of the language. You can just introduce a much simpler and more intuitive and much easier to implement interpretation. And closed world reasoning does not preclude open world reasoning — they are easy to use together because all databases that conform to an OWL ontology through a closed world interpretation are, by definition guaranteed to also conform to that same ontology under an open world interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually this glaring omission was addressed but it took more than a decade for the SHACL standard to emerge — a constraint language for RDF graphs. Unfortunately, by then the logicians had abandoned ship while the sausage factory remained — the standard that came out was once again full of logical inconsistencies and impractical and wrong design decisions. Meanwhile the semantic web community powered along in academia regardless, building castles in the sky — full of projects that aimed to build global federated semantic infrastructure which inevitably failed completely due to the fact that the bricks were made of paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/0*PsI8Kgud7OuiF__y.png&quot; alt=&quot;The W3Cs semantic web stack — confusing much? How about when you learn that it’s not anything remotely like a stack and several of the pieces do not exist.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is only the tip of the iceberg — there have been many more incoherent standards and initiatives that have come out of the W3C’s standards bodies — almost all of which have launched like lead balloons into a world that cares not a jot. Nevertheless, it is important to recognise that, hidden in all the nonsense, there are some exceptionally good ideas — triples, URL identifiers and OWL itself are all tremendously good ideas in essence and nothing else out there comes close. It is a sad testament to the suffocating nature of design by standards committee which has consumed countless hours of many thousands of smart and genuine researchers, that ultimately the entire community ended up getting it’s ass kicked by a bunch of Swedish hackers with a bunch of json blobs — the Neo4j property graph guys have had a greater impact upon the real world than the whole academic edifice of semantic web research.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Graph Fundamentals — Part 2: Labelled Property Graphs</title>
        <description>
            
            <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3840/1*FAK8MU1sYf6yrVpVmNQDzA.png" alt="cover image"/>
            
            
            &lt;p&gt;This is the second part of a four part series on the fundamental technologies underlying graph databases — &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/09/20/graph-fundamentals-part-1-rdf/&quot;&gt;the first covered RDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second major variant of graph databases is known as a property graph or labeled property graph (LPG). Property graphs are much simpler than RDF — they consist of a set of nodes and a set of edges, with each node and edge being a essentially a ‘struct’ — a simple data structure consisting of keys and values (which in some cases may themselves be structs). Nowadays JSON is the standard way of encoding these structs — each node and edge is a JSON document, with edges having special keys which indicate that the value represents a pointer to a node.
Whereas RDF uses URLs as identifiers for properties and entities, property graphs use simple strings — purely local identifiers. And while RDF uses the triple as the atom of data, property graphs do not — they are simply collections of arbitrary data-structures, some of which can point at other structures. A third major difference is that RDF is intimately associated with the semantic web. There are many layers that have been built on top to provide descriptions of the semantics of the entities described in RDF graphs. Property graphs, on the other hand, do not attempt to be self-describing at all; the meaning and interpretation of the structures is left up to the consumer of the data. They are just keys and values and, with the exception of edge links and a few other special keys, you can interpret them however you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;CREATE (a { name: 'Andy', title: 'Developer' })
CREATE (b { name: 'Bob', title: 'Manager' })
MATCH (a),(b)
WHERE a.name = 'Andy' AND b.name = 'Bob'
CREATE (b)-[r:MANAGES]-&amp;gt;(a)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of creating two nodes and an edge in Cipher, Neo4J’s self-rolled graph query and definition language. In the absence of universal identifiers, the nodes that were created have to be matched by a property value before the edge can be created.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To somebody coming from a semantic web background, property graphs seem like a very impoverished alternative indeed. I remember when I first came across Neo4j — the most popular property graph database on the market today — in the mid-2000s, being completely puzzled as to why anybody would want such a thing. &lt;em&gt;“It’s just a bunch of random structs pointing at one another — as if you took a program written in C and removed all the code leaving only the naked data structures and saved them to disk naked, without any meaningful typing or schema or any help in interpreting or constraining them.”&lt;/em&gt; And indeed, this perspective remains common among RDF aficionados — almost all of whom were, until recently, ensconced in academia and trained in semantics and distinctly look down on the relatively primitive nature of property graphs. This comes out most sharply in graph database conferences where one can almost taste the resentment that the property graph people feel towards the condescending RDF academic snobs who look down on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“It’s just a bunch of random structs pointing at one another — as if you took a program written in C and removed all the code leaving only the naked data structures and saved them to disk naked, without any meaningful typing or schema or any help in interpreting or constraining them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the property graph people persevered and while RDF and the semantic web might have the weight of academia and international standards bodies behind them, they have generally failed to make any significant impact upon the real world — while Neo4j and its host of modern imitators are by far the most popular type of graph database in the world and there are some very good reasons for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the similarity to programming language data structures is no coincidence. Neo4j started out as a library for the Java programming language (hence the 4j) that enabled them to create and store graph-like data-structures — this makes sense because Java as a language is particularly badly suited to modelling graph-like data-structures. By contrast, the semantic web community built the Jena framework in Java as it was meant to be — and ended up with a monstrosity of verbose class hierarchies. Stripped down data structures with pointers between them is a much, much better way of modelling graphs. Secondly, by ignoring all the fancy semantic stuff, the property graph people were not distracted by the outpouring of confusing, broken and misconceived standards that the W3C and academic semantics community produced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The property graph people, to their credit, took a pragmatic approach and focused on making a database that ordinary humans could understand. Furthermore, while the RDF community was always much more focused on semantics — with the graph structure being almost an implementation detail, a consequence of building everything on triples — property graphs were always fundamentally focused on the graph as the best abstraction for modelling the world. And as important use-cases emerged which used graph algorithms (fraud, page-rank, recommender systems) they were much better positioned to take advantage. RDF has a pure graph structure at a low-level but is often a confusing mess at a high level, while property graphs are the opposite — nodes represent things that are close to things in the world, edges represent relationships between things — all very intuitive, who cares that at a low level it is a primitive mess?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/3840/1*FAK8MU1sYf6yrVpVmNQDzA.png&quot; alt=&quot;An example of a labelled property graph and an equivalent RDF graph&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One consequence of this difference is that, when it comes to property graphs, it is relatively straightforward to add meta-data to edges — they are just structs after all and you can add whatever you like to the JSON blob representing an edge. This provides a straightforward way of adding qualifiers to edges — representing time, space or any other qualifier you want — to represent relationships with weights and lifespans, for example. In RDF, by contrast, edges of triples cannot have properties — it is relatively trivial to build more complex data-structures in RDF which represent qualified edges — but there are umpteen different ways of doing so and coming up with a standard way of doing so is not of particular interest to the semantic web academic community, who are much more focused on expressiveness and inference than such solved trivia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, property graphs provide a relatively simple mechanism that is easily understood by coders for modelling real world things and qualified relationships between them as against a bewildering blizzard of complex concepts that any new entrant to RDF land must endure. Over time, they also developed, in an evolutionary way, a query language called Cypher that is reasonably intuitive for coders — including some cute ways of representing graph edges:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;(a)-[relationship]-&amp;gt;(b)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the perspective of a formal query language, it is a mess — with structures that break compositionality for no good reason, and it remains a good 70 years behind the frontier of formal graph logic. Nevertheless, what they provide remains better, in practice, than anything the semantic web community ever came up with.
However, when dealing with very large graphs — billions of nodes and edges has become the norm today— their early pragmatism comes back to bite them with a vengeance. When graphs get really big and complicated, without a formal mathematical-logical basis for reasoning about graph traversals, leaving it all up to the individual query writer falls to pieces — the heat death of the universe lies around every corner.
Furthermore, as graph databases move from being toys for enthusiastic coders into serious enterprise tools, constraints and schemata become very much more important — who the hell wants to maintain the structure of a billion node mission-critical enterprise knowledge graph without any support from the computer? And why would you do so — applying constraints and rules to data structures is exactly what computers are good at— with decades of formal logic research to draw on. The cost of early pragmatism becomes a nightmare in the present because it is invariably impossible to engineer such fundamental aspects back into the core of the system. Furthermore, as systems become every bigger and more inter-connected, jettisoning URLs in favor of local identifier becomes an ever more serious impediment — throwing away universal, uniform, dereferenceable identifiers in the age of the web looks less and less wise. The cost of stitching together systems of local identifies in every new case adds up to many many times more trouble than it would have taken to just adopt URLs as universal identifiers initially.
Hence, despite their importance in the early days of graph databases, property graphs will likely fade out as knowledge graphs become adopted by enterprises and incorporated into their infrastructure — a well defined schema is not an optional in this — already they have been discarded by the best and most advanced new graph database providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the second part of a four-article series on graph fundamentals. The &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/09/20/graph-fundamentals-part-1-rdf/&quot;&gt;first article in the series covered RDF&lt;/a&gt;, the other major variant of graph databases around today, while the third and next part covers graph schema languages with particular focus on OWL, the most ambitious attempt yet to provide us with a language for talking about data.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Graph Fundamentals — Part 1: RDF</title>
        <description>
            
            <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1830/1*2F8lFQCruqyyGnKAXPx3jQ.png" alt="cover image"/>
            
            
            &lt;p&gt;Graph databases are on the rise, but amid all the hype it can be hard to understand the differences under the hood. This is the first article in a four part series describing the fundamental technologies that graph databases use under the hood. Unlike most articles that you will come across, this is neither marketing nor is it a tutorial — it’s a warts and all description of their strengths and weaknesses — stuff I have learned over 20 years of pain and suffering, in the hope that I can help somebody else out there to avoid having to learn these lessons the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two major variants of graph databases in the wild — RDF graphs (aka triple-stores) and Labelled Property Graphs. In this, the first article in the series, I’ll describe RDF (Resource Description Framework), its strengths and weaknesses and where it came from. In subsequent articles, I’ll describe labelled property graphs and some of the the standards and technologies that have been built on top of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RDF is a child of the web, formulated back in the 1990s, by Tim Bray at Netscape as a meta-data schema for describing things. The basic idea is simple, RDF files consist of a set of logical assertions of the form subject, predicate, object — known as a triple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;subject -&amp;gt; predicate -&amp;gt; object
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each triple expresses a specific fact about a subject:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mary -&amp;gt; likes -&amp;gt; john
mary -&amp;gt; is    -&amp;gt; human
john -&amp;gt; likes -&amp;gt; jane
jane -&amp;gt; likes -&amp;gt; chocolate
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When joined together a set of triples forms a graph consisting of nodes and edges — it really is as simple as that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/1830/1*2F8lFQCruqyyGnKAXPx3jQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;Knowledge Graph&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Triples can be combined to represent a knowledge graph which computers can interpret and reason about. When joined together, they form a natural graph, where the predicates (the middle part of the triple) are interpreted as edges and the subjects and objects are the nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far so good. In fact, &lt;strong&gt;triples are the ideal atom of information&lt;/strong&gt; — 3 degrees of freedom in our basic atomic expressions is sufficient for a self-describing system, 3 has the highest information density of any integer. We can build up a set of triples that describes anything describable. Binary relations, on the other hand, which are the basis of tables and traditional databases, can never be self-describing: they will always need some logic external to the system to interpret them — &lt;strong&gt;2 degrees of freedom is insufficient&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The triple as &lt;strong&gt;logical assertion&lt;/strong&gt; is also a tremendously good idea — one consequence is that we don’t have to care about duplicate triples — if we tell the computer that Mary likes John a million times, it is the same as telling it once — a true fact is no more nor less true if we say it 1000 times or 1 time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But RDF defined a lot more than just the basic idea of subject-predicate-object logical assertion triples. It also defined a naming convention where both the subject and predicate of each triple had to be expressed as a URL. The object of each triple could either be expressed as a URL or as a literal such as a number “6” or string “hat”. So our triples need to be of the form:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;http://my.url/john  -&amp;gt;  http://my.url/likes  -&amp;gt;  http://my.url/jane
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic idea being that if we load the URL of any subject, predicate or object, we will find the definition of the node or edge in question at that URL. So, if we load &lt;em&gt;http://my.url/likes&lt;/em&gt; into our browser, we find the definition of the &lt;em&gt;likes&lt;/em&gt; predicate. This design decision has both costs and benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost is immediate — URLs are much longer than the variable names used in programming language and they are hard to remember. This slows down programming as we can’t just use simple strings as usual, we have to refer to thing by their full URL. RDF tried to mitigate this cost by introducing the idea of namespace prefixes. That is to say, we can define: &lt;em&gt;prefix ex = http://my.url/&lt;/em&gt; and then we can refer to john as &lt;em&gt;ex:&lt;/em&gt;john rather than the full URL &lt;em&gt;http://my.url/&lt;/em&gt;john.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a programming point of view, these namespace prefixes certainly make it much easier to use RDF, but there is still considerable cost over traditional simple variable names — we have to remember which prefixes are available, which entities and predicates belong to which namespace, and type several extra characters for every variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Programming is an art form in which productivity is dependent on reducing the number of things that we have to remember at each step,&lt;/strong&gt; because we are concentrating on a big picture problem and need to focus all our concentration there rather than on the details of the lines of code. Speed of typing is also of paramount importance because we are almost always in a hurry and the faster we go, the less chance there is that we will forget something important along the way. From that point of view, using URLs as variable names, even with prefixes, is a massive cost to programming speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefits, on the other hand, are seen in the medium and long term. There is an old computer science joke:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;there are only 2 hard things in computer science: naming things, cache coherence and off-by-one errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a good joke because it is true — naming things and cache coherence really are the hardest things to get right — while off-by-one errors are just extremely common errors that novices make in loop control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RDF helps significantly to address both of the hard problems&lt;/strong&gt; — by forcing coders to think about how they name things and by using an identifier that is uniformly and universally addressable, the problem of namespace clashes (people using the same name to talk about different thing) is greatly reduced. What’s more, by linking an entity to its definition, it also greatly helps the cache coherence problem — everything has an authoritative address at which the latest definition is available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From an overall systems perspective, the extra programmer pain is tremendously worth it — if we know how something is named, we can always look it up and see what it is. By contrast, when we are dealing with traditional databases, the names used have no meaning outside the context of the local database — tables, rows and columns all have simple variable names which mean nothing except within the particular database in which they live, and there is no way of looking up the meaning of these tables and columns because it is opaque — embedded in external program code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, up to this point, it’s all positive — the use of logical subject-predicate-object triples as URL -&amp;gt; URL -&amp;gt; URL is actually a very good starting point for building data-structures. They allow us to describe anything we want in a way that is universally and uniformly named, addressable, retrievable and self-describing. The extra pain in having to use URLs instead of simple variable names is, in the long run, very much worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RDF, however, is much more than just the basic triple form. It also defines a set of reusable predicates. The most important one of these is &lt;strong&gt;rdf:type&lt;/strong&gt; — which allows us to define our entities as having a particular type:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ex:mary -&amp;gt; rdf:type -&amp;gt; ex:human
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This triple defines john as being of type ‘human’. This provides us with the basis for constructing a formal logic in which we can reason about the properties of things based on their types — if we know john is a human and not, for example, a rock, we can probably infer things about him without knowing them directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Formal logics are very powerful indeed because they can be interpreted by computers to provide us with a number of useful services — logical consistency, constraint checking, theorem proving, and so on. And they help tremendously in the battle against complexity — the computer can tell us when we are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-problem-with-rdf&quot;&gt;The Problem With RDF&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, however, that is where the good stuff ends. &lt;strong&gt;Almost every other design decision that went into the RDF specification was disastrously wrong.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first point is rather minor — RDF supports ‘blank nodes’, that is to say nodes that are not identified by a URL but instead by a local identifier (given a pseudo prefix like “_:name”). This is supposed to represent the situation where we want to say “some entity whose name I do not know” — to capture for example assertions such as “there is a man in the car”. As we don’t know the identity of the man, we use a blank node rather than a URL to represent him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was simply a mistake — it confuses the identity of the real world thing with the identity of the data structure that represents it. It introduces an element into the data structure that is not universally addressable and thus cannot be linked to outside its definition for no good reason. Just because we don’t know the identify of the thing, does not and should not mean we cannot address the structure describing the unknown thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s worse, RDF tools generally interpret blank nodes in such a way that their identifiers can be changed at will, meaning that it is hard to mitigate the problem in practice. Still, tool stupidity notwithstanding, such a poor design choice can be mitigated at the cost of some effort — for example by using a convention whereby blank nodes within a document can be addressed as a sub-path of the URL of the document that contains them. This at least allows them to be accessed through the same mechanism as all other nodes are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second major design flaw relates to the semantics that were published to govern the interpretation of triples and their types. To cut a long and technical story short, what they defined was — in a technical sense — nonsense. Logic, in a formal sense, is like probability: seemingly simple to the uninitiated but in fact horrendously difficult and full of counter-intuitive results and many traps for the naïve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is &lt;strong&gt;very easy&lt;/strong&gt; to construct a logical system that is incoherent or inconsistent — where the rules tell us that a given fact is both true and false. The most famous example is known as Russell’s paradox — the set of all sets that do not contain themselves — a paradoxical definition since this set must both contain itself and not contain itself. The basic rule of a logic is that &lt;strong&gt;if it is legal to express such paradoxes, then the logic is inconsistent&lt;/strong&gt; — we can’t rely on assertions defined in the logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RDF included explicit support for making statements about statements — what they called higher order statements — without putting in place any rules that prevented the construction of inconsistent knowledge bases. To put it simply, these semantics were completely wrong (or impredicative). In fact, RDF also included a broad suite of containers, distributive predicates and various other elements — in each case they were similarly wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1999, RDF 1.0 was made a standard by the web’s governing body, the W3C, and was enthusiastically promoted as the core of the future semantic web, despite the fact that it effectively described a nonsense system. How did this happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“ The web is the domain of engineers, not logicians. With the rise of the commercial software industry in the 1970s and 1980s, computer science based on formal logic was largely abandoned. Instead we got software engineering, based on turning programmers into money in as short a space of time as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To tell the truth, this wasn’t surprising — the web is the domain of engineers, not logicians. With the rise of the commercial software industry in the 1980s, computer science based on formal logic was largely abandoned. Instead we got software engineering, based on turning programmers into money in as short a space of time as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost nobody in the IT industry understands anything about formal computational logic nowadays save a few eccentric researchers labouring away in their labs on obscure topics completely ignored by industry. As a result, when it comes to things such as schema languages, constraint logics and so on, &lt;strong&gt;the industry’s most distinguished bodies repeatedly publish international standards that are just nonsense.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, the logical inconsistency of the RDF standard was only a minor factor in its failure to gain widespread adoption. A much worse mistake concerned the serialisation format that was chosen to express RDF textually: RDF/XML. Back in 1999, XML was relatively new and fashionable, so it was a natural choice, but the way in which RDF had to be shoehorned into XML created a horrifically confusing and ugly monster. In modern RDF circles, a format known as turtle is used to serialise triples as text. It is reasonably simple to interpret and concise to construct:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;@prefix rdf: &amp;lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&amp;gt;.
@prefix ex: &amp;lt;http://my.url/&amp;gt;.
ex:mary a ex:human;
ex:likes ex:john.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In RDF/XML this is constructed as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&quot; xmlns:ex=&quot;http://my.url/&quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;rdf:Description rdf:about=”ex:mary”&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;rdf:type rdf:resource=&quot;ex:human&quot;/&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;ex:likes rdf:resource=”ex:john”/&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/rdf:Desciption&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/rdf:RDF&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in 1999 when the RDF and RDF/XML standards were published, the social web was just taking off and a simple technology called RSS (really simple syndication) was at its core. RSS 0.91 was a very simple and popular meta-data format which allowed bloggers to easily share their updates with third party sites, enabling people to see when their favourite site had published updates, so that they didn’t have to check manually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably the greatest mistake ever made by the W3C was imposing RDF/XML as the new standard for RSS — RSS 1.0. There was a very quick revolution of bloggers who found the new standard vastly increased the complexity of sharing updates, without giving anything extra in return. Bloggers generally stuck to the old non-RDF 0.91 version — the ideological wars that this created effectively turned the world of web-developers against RDF — a blow that RDF and the W3C have never really recovered from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion-there-is-hope&quot;&gt;Conclusion: There Is Hope&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the terrible mistakes made in the definition of the RDF specification, at its very core, &lt;strong&gt;RDF remains by far and away the most advanced and sophisticated mechanism available for describing things in a computer interpretable way.&lt;/strong&gt; And the standard did not remain static — the W3C issued a series of new standards that refined and extended the original RDF and built several other standards on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second part of this series on graph fundamentals covers Labelled Property Graphs, the second major variant of graph databases today, while the third part covers graph schema languages with particular focus on OWL, the most ambitious attempt yet to provide us with a language for talking about data.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>TerminusDB — what’s in a name?</title>
        <description>
            
            <img src="/assets/images/terminusdb_logo.png" alt="cover image"/>
            
            
            &lt;p&gt;TerminusDB is an open source model driven graph database for knowledge graph representation designed specifically for the web-age. Our launch date is 1 October later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/terminusdb_logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;TerminusDB logo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core development team is busy putting the pieces into place and we are all really excited about bringing TerminusDB to the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll be pushing out plenty of content and documentation about the capabilities of the database over the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have long dreamed of a future where databases learn by automatically extracting information both from existing networked data-sources and from their users to continuously improve the reliability and accuracy of the information they contain. We wanted to build a database that would be capable of automatically generating sophisticated curation and analysis tools to allow users to access and manage the data they contain and to feed the results of these analyses into real-time automated workflows and learning algorithms. A big ask, but TerminusDB will be a strong step towards making it a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/1334/1*HleRZdBTjZqwcOBkeY8x2g.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;BDFL Gavin Mendel-Gleason&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Benevolent Dictator for Life is the one and only Gavin Mendel-Gleason. He’s a database maniac who dreams of logic, mathematics and formal methods. Gavin and the rest of the team have poured years of high-intensity work into building TerminusDB. Considerable innovation — both theoretical and practical — was required to build the database. Not only did we end up having to write the software ourselves, along the way we had to develop and formalise a new theoretical model of computer programming for data intensive systems; develop, formalise and prove a new modular logic for data objects; and devise, develop and deploy a new general purpose logical approach to describing and querying graph shapes and constraining their transitions. It has been a labour of love by all the contributing team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/672/1*f8egU0CASEEqGPmvma8Gyg.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Immovable &amp;amp; Persistent&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terminus was the Roman god of boundaries. He is an old Roman god — probably introduced by Romulus after the founding of the city. There is a famous story told of the last king of Rome (so disliked &amp;amp; proud that he was overthrown and the Republic declared) — he wanted to reshape Rome as an imperial capital and engaged in a large scale building programme. As part of his works, he set about reconstructing the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitol Hill. Tarquin thought that constructing a massive temple over the remains a holy site consecrated by Romulus would cement his place as a great King of Rome. To facilitate the reconstruction, the older shrines to various gods had to be removed; however, when they attempted to move the shrine of Terminus, it would not budge. Terminus was the immovable rock of the Capitol. Even Jupiter, the king of the gods, had to kneel to Terminus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/1658/1*lF_rZhXDtYOeBrEV1_3qLw.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;The Feast Before the Altar of Terminus. (c. 1642) By Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione (1609–1664)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ovid, the great Roman poet, writing 500 years later, interpreted these events:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘What happened when the new Capitol was built?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Where he was found, and shares the temple with great Jupiter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Even now there’s a small hole in the temple roof,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So he can see nothing above him but stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Since then, Terminus, you’ve not been free to wander:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Stay there, in the place where you’ve been put,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And yield not an inch to your neighbour’s prayers,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Lest you seem to set men above Jupiter.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terminus, as the God of boundaries, is particularly appropriate for our database management system. All good databases need boundaries — you need to know what’s in there and what isn’t. One of our major innovations in building TerminusDB is implementing a closed world version of OWL, the web ontology language. In the semantic web academic tradition, OWL has an open world assumption which means that the truth value of a statement may be true irrespective of whether or not it is known to be true. For TerminusDB any statement that is true must also be known to be true. This makes the database practical and usable for a broad range of industrial applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/844/1*J__EDmwjRNNVu4EkAbUEXA.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Design for a Stained Glass Window with Terminus. (31 December 1524) By Hans Holbein the Younger.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Roman God Terminus’ slogan ‘Concedo Nulli’ — concede to nobody — is also particularly appealing to the core TerminusDB team. As anybody who has delivered a production ready database will know, you have to walk through walls to get it done and yield to nobody. We bear the scars of those battles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/600/1*FTRE73m34GjDViAY1W25AA.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Terminus is the capital planet of the 1st Foundation&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asimov fans will also recognise Terminus as the home planet of the Foundation. Hari Seldon, inventor of Psychohistory, predicted a 30,000 year interregnum of barbaric dark ages until the rise of a New Empire. Seldon created a plan to shorten this interregnum from 30,000 years to 1,000 years. The Foundation was set up as an organisation intent on preserving all of human knowledge during the 1,000 years of chaos. Seldon’s true intention for the Foundation was to preserve the sciences and provide a political starting point for the Second Empire. The Foundation grows from Terminus to become a federation of planets under the direct control of Terminus or under its sphere of influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TerminusDB powers Seshat, the Global History Databank, which is like the Foundation in that Seshat is dedicated to bringing together the most current and comprehensive body of knowledge about human history in one place. The massive collection of historical information allows researchers to rigorously test different hypotheses about the rise and fall of large-scale societies and human history. The core TerminusDB team are active in the Cliodynamics community. Cliodynamics treats history as science — practitioners develop theories that explain such dynamic historical processes, translate these theories into mathematical models and then test predictions against data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/1814/1*kCm-Owh43PHf5h7UF-Oy8w.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;‘Ages of Discord’ by Peter Turchin&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The father of Cliodynamics, Peter Turchin, recently authored a book ‘Ages of Discord’, which uses cliodynamic approaches and the data in the Global History Databank to give an insight into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parallels to Asimov’s psychohistory are very strong. Cliodynamics is the real world version of psychohistory and Seshat is the real world version of the Foundation. And TerminusDB is the analogue of Terminus in the Foundation universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want people around the world to use our database, but we also want you to contribute to the project. We believe in the ideals of the free software movement. We’ll therefore release TerminusDB under GPL V3. That will allow everybody to inspect and use the full code base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe in a data-centric approach to development. Hoarding data in proprietary and complex applications is a mistake. Validation logic should be embedded in the data layer where it belongs and not housed in expensive to maintain application code. Long term cost of data ownership has been a huge consideration as we worked on this project.
TerminusDB contributors will be posting on this blog over the coming weeks and months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/400/1*_xTYaO0GlB_pyVCzb1AMJg.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;we can do it&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join the data-centric revolution!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Type and mode checking in prolog (part 2): mavis</title>
        <description>
            
            
            <img src="/assets/images/cover-image-03.jpeg" alt="cover image"/>
            
            &lt;p&gt;As we discussed in &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/06/07/type-and-mode-checking-in-prolog-part-1/&quot;&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt; of this short series on types in prolog, prolog has a rather graceful but silent method of reacting to a certain bugs. The exploitation of non-determinism can be extremely handy for searching spaces, but sometimes we just didn’t mean what we wrote, and instead of silent failure we would like to see an error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way around this problem which we presented in Part 1 was to use Hindley-Milner type (HM) checking to statically discover where we have variables which have a different type than we expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re going to take a different tack in this article and use dynamic type and mode checking with mavis. HM is great, but it wasn’t really written for prolog but for functional languages, and so doesn’t take any account of modes. It can also be a bit restrictive and heavy weight when modifying already existing code. We could of course dial it up, by introducing dependent types, but we’re not going to go there in this series (though how cool would this be?!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GavinMendelGleason/mavis&quot;&gt;Mavis&lt;/a&gt; we get to specify both modes and quite complex types in a gradual fashion, adding them as necessary. The downside is that type checking happens only at run-time and is not statically checked. Unfortunately this means we only catch bugs during testing or deployment, but at least we catch them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve used both techniques in production code and find them both useful, but currently Mavis is more fully featured and more flexible and so I’ve done most development with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is a mode? Prolog is a language of predicates, and we can think of any given substitution of variables as being either true or false at a predicate. But often times what we are actually doing when programming in prolog is taking what we know about some bound variables, in order to find other ones which would also satisfy the predicate. And very often we mean a predicate to only search for bindings given some set of already instantiated variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take for instance the following programme:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-prolog highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/**
 * zip(+A:list(any),+B:list(any),-C:list(any)) is det.
 * zip(-A:list(any),-B:list(any),+C:list(any)) is det.
 *
 * Zip two lists into a list of pairs (or unzip, in the other two
 * modes)
 */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;zip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;RestA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;RestB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;Zip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:-&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;zip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;RestA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;RestB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;Zip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;zip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([],[],[]).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefit of this declaration is obvious from the results of querying for the following goal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-prolog highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;?-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;zip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;ERROR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;Unhandled&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;The&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;term&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;domain&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have effectively stopped zip from silently failing in the event of passing nonsense arguments. But what do all of these complicated mode descriptions mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two mode-lines given for the above programme. We use a preceding ‘+’ to denote required arguments and ‘-’ to denote supplied arguments. If an argument is required (‘+’), it must be bound at the time the predicate is called. If it is supplied (‘-’), it can be bound or not, but we will guarantee that we supply a binding if it is unbound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact binding time status is a bit more complicated than this. It’s quite possible to have a ‘skeleton’ which has unbound variables inside of a defined term. For instance, you can obtain such a skeleton of a list with the goal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-prolog highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;?-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;L&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;_6186&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;_6192&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;_6198&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;? Mavis interprets it as bound if it is compatible with the type declaration. To require a completely defined input you can use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;++&lt;/code&gt;. In the future we want to include more specific user-defined designations modeling ourselves after those given in Mercury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/inner-image-03.png&quot; alt=&quot;Mercury Diagram&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final part of the mode describes the amount of determinism that the predicate is expected to have. Zip above is considered to be ‘det’ which means in all the modes that are described, and subject to its inputs being well typed, it will return precisely one substitution. The different determinism qualifiers are listed in the mavis documentation as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;failure: 0 solutions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;semidet: 0 or 1 solution&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;det: 1 solution&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;multi: more than one solution&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;nondet: Any number of solutions including 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;em&gt;allowable&lt;/em&gt; modes which are &lt;em&gt;covered&lt;/em&gt; by the above given modes to make things a little more confusing. For instance, I can call zip with the following two different goals, both of which are accepted as legitimate and do not yield errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-prolog highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;?-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;zip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;?-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;zip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first case we supplied all of the arguments. This is more informative than any of the modes given, and consequently causes the determinsm to be &lt;em&gt;demoted&lt;/em&gt;. We shift from being ‘det’ to being ‘semidet’. This demotion is taken care of for us automatically by mavis.
We can also run the query &lt;em&gt;backwards&lt;/em&gt;, since we have supplied the appropriate mode line above. This is the main reason we might want to specify multiple mode lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-prolog highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;?-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;zip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mavis is really useful for finding bugs in production code during testing. I’ve recovered a large number of confusions, especially in the case of errors in my own thinking regards the determinism of various predicates. This can in turn have huge impacts on performance, since uncontrolled and unintended non-determinism can have surprisingly large impacts on speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are however a number of things I’m unhappy with and I would like to see improved. I’ll list them out here as a sort of wish-list for mavis in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There should be a good deal more that is done statically. Many of the mode and type declarations give plenty of information to yield compile time errors.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;With a bit more declarative work we could even reordered queries automatically to produce much more desirable outcomes for specific modes — and in some cases we could even improve the termination behaviour!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The types should at least give us the flexibility of Hindley-Milner type declarations with free type variables which can be used repeatedly. This would give us a much more pleasing and specific type for ‘zip’.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Someday in the not too distant future it would be nice to see dependent types making their way in. For the dynamic case, as we currently have with mavis, this shouldn’t even be too terribly hard to implement in a hacky sort of way!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Prolog meta-interpretation for syntax checking</title>
        <description>
            
            <img src="/assets/images/cover-image-02.png" alt="cover image"/>
            
            
            &lt;p&gt;Prolog is a fantastic toolkit for developing Domain Specific Languages (DSLs). Lexing and parsing are a breeze with the use of Declarative Clause Grammars (DCGs), and writing a interpreter or compiler is an essentially rule-based transformation problem anyhow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But before we set about interpreting or compiling an expression, we need to know that a term, represented as an abstract syntax tree (AST) is well formed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing a predicate which admits only those terms which conform to a given syntax is likewise very convenient in prolog. For instance, if we wanted to write down a predicate that checks the well-formedness of integer bearing lists, we might write it as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-prolog highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;isa_int_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([]).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;isa_int_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:-&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;isa_integer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;isa_int_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we undertake to use this predicate, we can certainly tell if a (already ground) list is well-formed. However, if it is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; well formed, we are not given an enormous amount of feedback. We are instead entreated to the singularly uninformative result:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-prolog highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;?-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;isa_int_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, we know it’s not an integer list, and given that we have an incredibly simple syntax, we can spot right away with the naked eye, the problem with the term. However, if the term is large, and the syntax is complex, returning false will not necessarily enlighten us to the source of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past I’ve dealt with this problem by writing relatively complicated syntax checkers, which throw errors when terms are known to be ill-formed, or keep track of failures to report to the top level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This unfortunately defeats the clear expressive rule based qualities of the above code which neatly captures what we mean when we say that we have a list of integers. It both complicates the code, and increases the probability that you’ll not even express the intended conditions in the predicate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;enter-the-metainterpreter&quot;&gt;Enter the metainterpreter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where metainterpretation comes to the rescue. Metainterpretation is a strategy for implementing custom interpretation of terms in prolog, using the fact that prolog is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity&quot;&gt;homoiconic&lt;/a&gt; and we can easily appropriate functionality from the host system. For an overview of metainterpretation, it’s worth reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metalevel.at/markus.jpg&quot;&gt;Markus Triska’s&lt;/a&gt; examples here, or looking at the relevant section in &lt;a href=&quot;https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/art-prolog-second-edition&quot;&gt;The Art of Prolog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of writing a new predicate, we can reuse our predicate coupled with a metainterpreter which assumes a number of things about the predicate in question. We demand that the predicate be deterministic, i.e. it succeed in assigning the term to our accepted class in precisely one way. This is similar to the constraint that most type systems use to simplify checking and inference. We also demand that it draw from a relatively small number of primitive predicates and avoid cuts or other impurities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can look at the code here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GavinMendelGleason/typo&quot;&gt;https://github.com/GavinMendelGleason/typo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our metainterpreter will then execute the predicate, bit by bit, and return none in the event that there is no &lt;strong&gt;error&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;just&lt;/strong&gt;(Error) in the case that something has gone wrong. The Error will carry with it all the information about &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; failed approaches to accepting the term. With this in hand, we can either look at the full failure tree, or we can use the quite effective heuristic, that the deepest failure is likely to be the one that almost succeeded. We can do this by calling &lt;strong&gt;deepest&lt;/strong&gt;/2 to give us back the longest error stack. We can then print this stack with &lt;strong&gt;write_stack&lt;/strong&gt;/1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what happens when we try our initial example with our metainterpreter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-prolog highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;metainterpret&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;isa_int_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;ME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;ME&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;just&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;deepest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;write_stack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;an&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;integer&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;Left&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;conjuct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;fails&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;isa_integer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;No&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;successful&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;clause&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;predicate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;isa_int_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;Right&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;conjuct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;fails&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;isa_int_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;No&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;successful&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;clause&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;predicate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;isa_int_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;Right&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;conjuct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;fails&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;isa_int_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;No&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;successful&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;clause&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;predicate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;isa_int_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of false, we’ve found the most likely cause of failure, and the entire path up the syntax tree which resulted in the cascading failure!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course the reporting can be done differently, and the heuristic might vary with different uses, but I’ve found this an effective way of describing what has gone wrong. I’ve even found a bug in production code which was exposed when applying the metainterpreter as it tracked down an inadvertent non-determinism!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The take-away lesson for me was that sometimes its better to write a simple metainterpreter than it is to complicate your code. DSLs in prolog are easy to write and you can even write DSLs to help you write your DSLs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes meta is betta!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;When it comes to languages for rule processing, prolog has them all beat. It has so many exciting features that make it incredibly flexible, among them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;backtracking: we can try several strategies to solve a problem, and roll back if one doesn’t work. This also give us generators and testors using the same framework, enabling guess and check approaches to algorithms.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;homoiconicity: which enables incredible metalogical madness including term and goal expansion and simplifying the writing of meta-interpreters.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DCGs (Declarative Clause Grammars): regexps are great, but when your language isn’t regular, DCGs give us one of the nicest ways to parse input around.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet when trying to write large software packages in anger for industrial purposes, there are some unfortunate warts that tend to plague this otherwise beautiful language. I’ve compiled a fairly long mental list, but right now I want to talk about two of these awkward elements and what to do about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you write a predicate in prolog, you can often make a very efficient choice between clauses in the predicate by carefully choosing terms which enable us to discriminate between the clauses we would like to “fire”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-prolog highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;term_a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;term_a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;term_b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;term_b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we invoke &lt;strong&gt;p(term_a)&lt;/strong&gt; we are graciously treated to the expected printout. And perhaps even better we, with a prolog such as swipl, we don’t even end up with any remaining choice-points due to the indexing of the argument, making our choice efficient as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in large scale projects, it can happen that we call &lt;strong&gt;p&lt;/strong&gt;/1 with something quite unexpected, perhaps with term_c, due either to a typo, or a thought-o. Prolog’s method of dealing with this is to silently fail — and since failure in prolog is a normal course of events, the result can lead to irritating bug-searches which take quite a while to narrow the problem to its source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course what we want for &lt;strong&gt;p&lt;/strong&gt;/1 is to correctly type it. That is, we want to be able to add some additional information to p about the domain of its arguments such that we can dynamically, or even better, statically, determine that they are not of the required variety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hindley-milner-and-type_check&quot;&gt;Hindley Milner and type_check&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system&quot;&gt;Hindley-Milner&lt;/a&gt; (HM), a type system which allows us to write down just the sort of thing we’re concerned about when we call &lt;strong&gt;p&lt;/strong&gt;/1. HM has a great number of advantages, allowing both inference of types in many cases, and the ability to write down our types in a nice algebraic fashion. It also includes many extensions which might be convenient in the case of prolog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how does HM work? Thanks to the work of Tom Schrijvers et al. we can try it out with the swipl package ‘&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.swi-prolog.org/pack/list?p=type_check&quot;&gt;type-check&lt;/a&gt;’. For our p above we can now write the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-prolog highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;use_module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;library&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;type_check&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;term&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;---&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;term_a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;term_b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;pred&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;term&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;term_a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;term_a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;term_b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;term_b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we add a type ‘term’ which is term_a, or (represented by the ‘;’) a term_b. We can now declare the arguments of our predicate p with a ‘pred’ declaration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now when we load our file, ‘type_check’ will attempt to find any type errors present in the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first result of loading this file is the following message:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-prolog highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;% TYPE WARNING: call to unknown predicate `write(term_a)'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;%     Possible Fixes: - add type annotation `::' to call&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;%                     - replace with call to other predicate&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:-&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;'HERE'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;term_a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;% TYPE WARNING: call to unknown predicate `write(term_b)'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;%     Possible Fixes: - add type annotation `::' to call&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;%                     - replace with call to other predicate&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:-&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;'HERE'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;term_b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;% Type checking for module `first_blog' done:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;% found type errors in 0 out of 2 clauses.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;% Well-typed code can't go wrong!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially our type-checker is telling us that it doesn’t know anything about &lt;strong&gt;write&lt;/strong&gt;/1. Unfortunately the majority of standard ISO prolog is unknown to type-check. To really make it work properly for building software in the large we would need to add type annotations to our library. However, we have three different work-arounds provided by ‘type-check’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first two work-arounds I’ll demonstrate in tandem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-prolog highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;pred&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;term&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;term_a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;term_a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;term_b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;term_b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we add type &lt;em&gt;annotations&lt;/em&gt; to the code to inform the type checker that it can assume the type of the arguments of &lt;strong&gt;write&lt;/strong&gt;/1 to be of type ‘any’. Both of these annotations appear to achieve the same outcome, however the former adds an additional wrapper to the call, ensuring that the arguments are &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; of the appropriate type dynamically. The second is nothing more than a “trust-me” style hint to the type checker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly we can build up a database of trust-me style hints using the following syntax:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-prolog highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;trust_pred&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can imagine how this could be extended to much of the standard library, for instance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-prolog highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;trust_pred&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This establishes that any call with append is to be treated as though it takes a list of some unknown type, another list of that same unknown type, and returns an output list of that type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given we have used one of these methods to properly type our predicate p, we can look at what type_check reports when we utilise p wrongly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-prolog highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;use_module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;library&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;type_check&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;term&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;---&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;term_a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;term_b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;pred&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;term&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;term_a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;term_a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;term_b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;term_b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;pred&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;q&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;term_c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The predicate &lt;strong&gt;q&lt;/strong&gt;/0 is where we have inserted our buggy call. And indeed, type_check reports:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-prolog highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;TYPE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;ERROR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;expected&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;unknown_type' for term `term_c'&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;inferred&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;term'
 in goal:
   p(term_c)
 in clause:
q :-
    '&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;term_c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, type_check has shown us our error, and we can now correct our bug at compile time rather than having to wait until we see the error in production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;typing-in-the-real-world&quot;&gt;Typing in the real world&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is really great, but there are some caveats. The type_check library really needs to have a few kinks ironed out for it to work in industrial practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing is that the full standard library needs to be given appropriate typing in a library, so that you don’t have to constantly run around typing everything. And in order to do this, type_check needs to be made module aware, which it currently is not. Module-awareness adds a good deal of complexity as well — how do we import types for instance?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the addition of dynamic checks at boundaries is absolutely fantastic, and precisely the right way to ease a language like prolog into using static typing disciplines. However, when should we apply these type checks? This leads us to the question of mode checking. We will look at dynamic type checking and dynamic mode checking in the next article on mavis.&lt;/p&gt;
